Those people who get to be part of your inner circle. The ones you feel safe to be yourself with. The ones you can share your best and most vulnerable moments with. These people that we connect with deeply are essential to our health and longevity. Good quality relationships show up in the research as the most powerful predictor of a long, healthy and happy life. But they are not the only people we need in our lives. There are many people that play a meaningful role in our lives (as we do in theirs) without ever developing a deep and personal connection. I think recognising the value in the diverse relationships that we encounter is one way to appreciate that each offers us something to learn from and feel grateful for. The aim is not to be left with just the people in that inner circle, but to use boundaries effectively so that we can safely experience a variety of relationships. What are your thoughts on this?

We block them out with anything that feels safe and pleasurable. But when we do that, the painful emotions don’t always disappear forever. We find ourselves trapped in cycles of addictive behaviours that keep the emotion at bay for just a short time. 

The way we guide people to process painful emotion in therapy is to allow the emotion to be there, turn towards it and feel it, while soothing yourself through the process with skills that help you to tolerate the distress. This enables the emotion to take its natural course and wash over you. Emotions come in waves so we know they will increase in intensity, peak and then come back down again.

Does it happen more with certain people and less with others? Or maybe it happens more when the choice is one that enables you to hold your own needs as equal to others. 

That need we feel to justify ourselves and offer up detailed explanations can be seen as a safety behaviour. An action that helps to bring down the fear associated with holding a boundary. It works temporarily but, in the long term, leads to an increased need to do the same. We find ourselves trapped and unable to hold a boundary if we feel we can’t avoid the disapproval of others.

Maybe asserting yourself in the past led to rejection, abandonment or a complete override of your own needs. Maybe love was conditional. Or maybe it was considered your responsibility to ensure that others remained happy. However the cycle began, it can be broken. It takes time and practise. And it always starts with awareness. So start looking out for those times when you hold a boundary and immediately follow it up with over-explaining and justifying yourself to others.

It won’t arrive spontaneously.TIPS FOR BUILDING CONFIDENCE BELOW: 
• Action builds confidence over time. 
• Rather than big, one-off actions, go for consistency over intensity. Repetition that you can sustain is crucial for building confidence.
• You don’t have to overwhelm yourself. Start small and manageable in the stretch zone where you make most progress with performance. 

The model in this video is adapted from Karl Rohnke’s Comfort, Stretch and Panic model, which was developed based on the Yerkes-Dodson law. This law posits that peak performance happens when people experience a moderate amount of pressure.

 Hands up on the comments who else tends to set a massive goal and then go all for a a week or two before fizzling out? If you do you’re not alone. I think we do this when we favour intensity over consistency. But if we can commit to a change that is small enough to persist at over time then the gains far exceed that short but intense burst. 

So when you want to make a change, focus less on what the results might be and when they will arrive. Instead focus on creating a process that feels easy enough to do consistently. Once it becomes a part of your everyday routine your brain is great at starting to automate some of that for you so that you don’t have to rely on motivation as much as when you started.

 The example of the plane in this video was inspired by James Clear who is another great translator of the research on habit change. Others include Charles Duhigg and BJ Fogg.

What else would you add to these? Share with me in the comments what you wish everybody understood about depression.

Nobody can know these things until they know, so these conversations about mental health are helping to squash some of the old misconceptions that were once widely held. Those misconceptions can hold people back in their own recovery. They can also hold people back from being able to support in the most effective way. 

Here are some more tips for how to support someone with their mental health:

* It’s ok if you don’t know how to talk about the painful stuff. You don’t have to be a therapist to be a great support. For example, distraction from your own distress by chatting with a friend can be just as helpful.
* If you are not sure what is the right thing to say, tell them. Let them know that you care about them and want to help, but have no idea how. Ask them what support would be most helpful to them right now.
* Try to help in ways that promote recovery rather than hinder it. For example, if your loved one is managing to cook for themselves, join them but don’t take over the activity. Taking a break from something can make it harder to go back to it. Instead, help like offering childcare while they go to therapy or a doctor makes working on recovery easier.

This is a common fear that prevents many people from talking about how they feel or accessing therapy. But there is a misconception about how you work through trauma in therapy. A therapist will never ask you to bring up old wounds until they trust that you can manage those painful emotions safely. And one of the reasons that therapy takes time is that it’s not done all at once. Things are done at your own pace in a safe space and only when you both decide that you are ready.

Which do you notice in your relationships? Is the other person using your emotions to get what they want? Emotional manipulation can be very subtle and hard to spot. But when it becomes pervasive some of the telltale signs can be feelings of confusion about how you keep overriding your own knowledge, instincts and values when making decsions. Increasing self-doubt and uncertainty in your own judgement leads you to give even more power to the other person. Once you start to notice when this is happening, there is opportunity for change. Starting to put in new boundaries with someone who has previously had full control in a relationship is not an easy process. So getting support from a trusted friend or therapist to help on that path is often a good idea. If anyone would like me to do a video on how to start holding boundaries, let me know in the comments.

(BTS in my stories) Here’s why eliminating stress is not the answer. Quite simply because it’s impossible. Just like that hose pipe, we can’t switch it off. Life will always find new challenges to throw our way. But the good news is that we don’t have to be at the mercy of it. There are lots of things we can learn that help us to bring down the intensity of the stress response, or to create a release valve that means we have more capacity to deal with things tomorrow.

An ability to neglect or even completely disregard your own emotions while being highly sensitive to how everyone else is feeling around you. 

This often makes sense when you start to unravel the learning that occurred in early life when you were entirely dependent on the adults around you. But once we reach adulthood, that way of relating to people can make it more difficult to find personal fulfilment or to have healthy relationships. 

Do you notice this showing up in your own life? When does it happen? And what does it cost you? What price do you pay for only listening to the emotions of others?

One of the biggest mistakes people make when working on big change is underestimating the power of those small, consistent actions that embed us in a new way of living. If we can focus on the small, daily steps in the process, the results start to take care of themselves. And when we take on the new process as a part of our identity, it no longer takes the conscious effort and motivation that it needed when you first started. It’s just who you are now.

We do things because we’ve always done them, and over time they become part of who you are. Think about all the things you just do naturally day to day. 

So, when we’re trying to build new habits, we need to see the thing as a part of who we are if we want it to feel like an easier lift. That’s when positive affirmations can come in. 

For example: you want to write a newsletter, but imposter syndrome is creeping in and you keep telling yourself no one wants to hear what you have to say. Well of course you’re not going to start. 

But if you tell yourself “I have tons of ideas and I’m actually super excited about becoming a better writer by pressing send every week”, you’re much more likely to form that new habit and build motivation.

We block them out with anything that feels safe and pleasurable. But when we do that, the painful emotions don’t always disappear forever. We find ourselves trapped in cycles of addictive behaviours that keep the emotion at bay for just a short time. 

The way we guide people to process painful emotion in therapy is to allow the emotion to be there, turn towards it and feel it, while soothing yourself through the process with skills that help you to tolerate the distress. This enables the emotion to take its natural course and wash over you. Emotions come in waves so we know they will increase in intensity, peak and then come back down again.

When your threat response is triggered, you are in survival mode. When your brain senses that you might not be safe, speed is more important than accuracy. So your brain does a great job of anticipating threats and jumping to conclusions in order to keep you safe. This means your brain is not taking the time to consider all potential perspectives. It skips all that and takes a short cut to the ideas that could help keep you safe (if that is needed). This speed of processing and a focus on safety leads to bias. We can’t stop that bias. But we can take the power out of it by familiarising ourselves with the types of bias to look out for and naming those thought biases when we notice them. Then we can be open to considering alternative perspectives. Below are a few thought biases that come up with anxiety:

Personalising - this is when we take an ambiguous situation and assume it’s about us. E.g. my friend didn’t wave back. She must hate me.

Catastrophising - when your brain offers up the worst case scenario that hasn’t happened yet and plays it out for you like a movie on repeat, triggering more anxiety.

Spotlight effect - this when we overestimate how much other people are judging us negatively. Something we all do, but do more of when we are anxious.

We expect every day to be a little bit better than the last. So when we hit a hurdle and have a bad day or a bad week, we tell ourselves that we are back at square one and feel like giving up. But when we can expect tough days along the way and appreciate that they are a normal part of the process, we can focus our efforts on getting back on track, rather than wasting time trying to decide whether to quit or keep going.

Who else gets that rush of guilt when you have to say no or hold a boundary? Join the club! But that guilt might be more to do with learning earlier in life that the needs and feelings of others always trump your own. That is was your job to keep others happy. Sometimes guilt can tell us that we are not doing the right thing. But guilt is not a fact. Listen to it. Then make your decision  taking into account your needs too.

Does your world come crashing down around you, even with small mistakes? If you notice that happens, it’s a great opportunity to learn something important about yourself. Here’s some of the questions to ask yourself:
• What feelings have come up in reaction to this mistake?
• Were those feelings more intense than they might have been for others in this situation?
• What thoughts came up about me, or others, or the world?
• What urges came up? Maybe urges to escape, self-punish, or lash out at someone else? 
• What does this mistake mean to you? Do you believe it says something about who you are as a person? Look for those “I am” statements, such as “I am a failure” or “I am unloveable” 

Those statements that seem to get triggered and then cause intense pain, can often reflect some damaging core beliefs about ourselves or the world. We are not consciously aware of them all the time. But they rise up when we find even the slightest sign that they might be true, no matter how much evidence we have to the contrary. This is called confirmation bias. Shaking up core beliefs is highly psychologically threatening because it disrupts our ability to predict the world around us. So, even when a belief is not a healthy (or true) one, your brain will look to confirm it before letting it go.

More tips for coping with a breakup ??

• We don’t only grieve when people die. We grieve when relationships end and things change. We grieve for the loss of what we dreamt that relationship could be. We grieve for the aspects of that relationship that we miss, even if other parts of it were damaging. So let yourself grieve, without attaching the assumption that it means you should return to it.
• When you find yourself preoccupied with the other person’s behaviour after the breakup, remind yourself that you cannot control how others behave. You cannot allow your wellbeing to be determined by another. Take your life into your own hands and start working on constructing this new life in which you look after yourself, trusting that it was right for the relationship to end. 
• If you know the relationship was damaging but you find yourself looking back with rose tinted glasses, take action to ensure that you make informed choices. Not choices based on an idealised view of someone who couldn’t live up to that all the time. Write down and remind yourself of the clear reasons that you decided the relationship was not right for you.

Tips for people pleasers below 

• Balancing your own needs with those of others is not a sign of selfishness. It is a sign of emotional maturity. When we start to set boundaries, how we frame it in our minds is crucial to help us with the guilt feelings that often come up when we start making changes.
• If you notice that your identity is wrapped up in your care taking roles, this can make it even more difficult to make changes. It’s ok to still have that but there may be room to expand your sense of who you are to include other areas of your life and other skills that you have.
• If you are no longer sure what your own preferences are because you have always deferred to what others want, then it’s time to start experimenting with small decisions and reflecting on your own experiences. 
• Keep reminding yourself that it is possible to say no and still be a good person.

• Anxiety is not bad and we can’t (and wouldn’t want to) eliminate it altogether. It is simply your body’s alarm system trying to keep you safe.
• The fear response naturally gives us the urge to avoid the feared situation. But avoidance is only the best outcome if the situation is truly dangerous. 
• We may feel anxiety simply because we are trying something new and the novel situation triggers the stress response. This is your brain allowing you to be alert because we don’t know how this situation goes.
• So when that alarm sounds in your body and mind, you get to decide whether you keep moving forward or you escape to safety.
• To live a full life alongside natural human anxiety we must base choices on our values. By this I mean, the kind of person you want to be, the contribution you want to make and what you want your actions to represent. 
• Getting clarity on your own personal values and what matter most to you is a brilliant way to make the best choices in the face of fear. I use it all the time. 

 For all the details on how to do this, you can follow the values check-in exercises in my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? Currently half price at £8. See link in my bio for hardback and audio book versions."

See below for what to do about it. ??

• Your attachment style is not your fault. These are the patterns of relating to our caregivers from the early years of our lives. But while they develop early in life, we don’t have to be at the mercy of them. 
• The first place to start is getting to know how your attachment style seems to impact on how you show up in your relationship today. Start keeping a journal. Pay attention to the times when you need connection, but seem unable to seek it out, or when you think your partner is making a bid for connection and you experience that as a threat.
• Share your discoveries with your partner. If they understand that you are working on this, they will be in a better place to support you in the way that you need them to.
• If intimacy feels threatening or uncomfortable, take your time. Talk to your partner about what small changes you would like to make.

(This reel took a few goes )
We all get overworked and tired every now and then but burnout is more than tiredness. Burnout is when stress becomes chronic and has a detrimental effect on other areas in your life. 

Signs of burnout include chronic exhaustion alongside restlessness and trouble sleeping, poor self-care such as diet and exercise. Other signs include repeated emotional distress, such as anxiety, low mood, or anger outbursts. You may notice your performance at work is going down, while you feel you are working harder than ever, you may also start feeling disconnected with loved ones and struggle to get along as well as you normally do.
Below are some tips on how to prevent burnout but if you want more on this and how to make stress start working for you, see the link in my bio for my no.1 Sunday Times Bestseller, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It’s currently half price (£8) in hardback and free when you sign up to Audible. 

A few tips on burnout:
 Start working out what you can say no to. Often we feel obliged to say yes to every request or opportunity. When our health is in question, it’s a pretty good reason to practice the art of saying no to things that are not an absolute priority.
 Prioritise self-care. Get back to basics because they are the foundations of good mental and physical health. Make sleep, healthy food, hydration, exercise and social time top of your to do list. And don’t underestimate the power of these things to build your resilience.
 Re-think what matters. We are vulnerable to burnout when we are working hard on something that is not in line with our own values. Instructions on this in my book. 
 Get support. If you are worried about your mental health in any way, seeking support from a trusted friend or a professional is key. Human connection is a powerful tool. Use it.

Who else feels afraid that if you allow any of your emotions to surface, that they’ll all rise up and never go back down again? This is a common fear that prevents many people from talking about how they feel or accessing therapy. But there is a misconception about how you work through trauma in therapy. A therapist will never ask you to bring up old wounds until they trust that you can manage those painful emotions safely. And one of the reasons that therapy takes time is that it’s not done all at once. Things are done at your own pace in a safe space and only when you both decide that you are ready.

But if you do not feel that way yet, it’s ok to make it happen by recognising that looking after yourself helps you to be the best you can be for your loved ones.

• If some of the points in this video sound familiar, it’s worth reading up on anxious attachment styles in more depth. 
• The first step is to build awareness of where these patterns came from and how they are affecting your adult relationships now.
• It is worth remembering that you didn’t choose this. But you also don’t have to be at the mercy of it. 
• The patterns helped you to feel safe as a child but are now outdated and tend to cause problems in adult relationships. So try not to be too hard on yourself when you follow the old patterns. They are hard cycles to break because they worked for many years.

But do we ever stop to think about whether we live by that, not only towards others, but to ourselves? 

If you had to endure bullying in your childhood, either in school or your own home, it is possible that you internalised the voice of those bullies as your own. This is not a mistake. It’s your own brain anticipating those responses before they happen so you can stay safe. But, now you are an adult, and hopefully in a safer environment, that self-criticism and self-attack no longer serves you in the same way. Instead, it will be holding you back by keeping you in a state of fight or flight. 

One way to start working on this is to document it. Start journalling about how you respond to yourself in both positive and negative situations.

See below for what to say instead ??

• “People will forget what you said…but will never forget how you made them feel.” - Maya Angelo. This quote rings true when you are trying to support someone who is struggling. Focus less on getting the exact words right, and more on how you are trying to make them feel. 
• Aim to make them feel safe, secure, respected, and listened to, really listened to.
• Park any judgement that arises and turn your mind to curiosity. Seek only to understand. 
• Ask about when things feel better, when they feel worse, what helps, and what makes it more difficult. As you build a detailed picture of what it is like for them, they will also benefit from the insight gained by reflecting on it in this way.
• Ask them how you can best support them. Take the guessing game out of it. Many people already have a clear idea of what would help them. It can be as simple as consistently showing up to be a friend.
• Remember, you are not here to solve all their problems. Don’t underestimate the power of simply being there and showing you care.
• You can help in practical ways, like babysitting while they attend therapy appointments or joining them to go out for a walk every day. Try to support them in things that will steer toward recovery.

These are just a few of the factors that can lead to procrastination. For anyone looking for tips on how to overcome it so that you can get on with the things that matter to you, I’ve included a few points below. 

Points for tackling procrastination:

•Turn from the self-criticism to curiosity. So rather than get hard on yourself for it, ask yourself why it might be happening and be ready to get honest with yourself.

•If a task feels overwhelming, don’t expect yourself to do it all at once. Break it down into tiny steps that don’t feel so daunting.

•Start your day with the hardest task first. Minimise the time you have to talk yourself out of it, if that is what you do.

•Start questioning your relationship with failure. Perfectionism makes us afraid to fail which can create a block to progress and risk taking. Learning about growth mindset can help this.

• Get really honest with yourself about whether the goal is your own or someone else’s. Keep connected to why you are working toward this thing to help you over the hump of not feeling like it.

?Tragedies don’t happen in isolation. The ripple effects are often felt throughout your family and friends. When so many people are trying to process what has happened, some people may hold back on talking to anyone, while others can offload onto the people who don’t have the capacity to give support.
 
?Psychologist Susan Silk developed the concept of Ring Theory after her own experience with breast cancer. She noticed that well-intentioned loved ones and acquaintances would complain to her about the impact of her own illness at a time when she could not offer support to them. She suggests that it helps to think about the rings of support around the crisis, with the people closest to the event at the centre of those rings. Silk says, offer support where you can to those closer to the centre of things, while turning to those further removed from the tragedy for your own support.
 
Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, and it is important to talk openly and honestly with loved ones. When choosing who to reach out to for support, always base that decision on your understanding of the loved one that you already know so well. Some people do find benefit in being able to care for others, even through terrible times. Asking people and respecting their answers is key.

2. Be willing to do it badly and without feeling confident, for as long as it takes to get better.

What is more important to me is that when your body is sending you signals that all is not ok, that we don’t brush it off, but listen to it. All those signs from how we feel in body and mind have something useful to tell us about what we need, and which of those needs are not being met. So if you are ever asking yourself, “Could I be depressed?” It undoubtedly means that your mental health could do with your attention. You do not need to meet the criteria for a particular disorder to start paying attention to your health and getting any support you may need to do that most effectively.

The chances are that someone you brush shoulders with today will be fighting their way through something. It may take all their strength to look you in the eye, smile and say hello. The simplest way to improve the moment for them, or in the very least, not make things worse, is to choose kindness. Every time ??

It’s worth pointing out that high functioning anxiety is not a clinical term or diagnosis. It is not something that is wrong with you. But there is likely plenty of things in your environment contributing to it. So here’s the tips for anyone dealing with persistent high levels of anxiety.

• Some anxiety is normal but chronic  stress leads to an array of long term health problems, so firstly, take it as seriously as any other health issue.
• Not all stress can be chosen. Life just throws it our way. But the stress response is a short-term use tool. It works best when we give the body and mind time for deep rest and replenishment. If you’re honest with yourself, are you making time for that? Are you filling free moments with more stress, like checking your emails while eating your dinner? 
• Which stressors in your life cannot be controlled and which ones could you make decisions to change? Often when we don’t allow enough time for rest and replenishment it’s because we have taken too much on, not all of which may be necessary.
• Look at that tendency to take on too much with curiosity. What do you think that is about? What pressures are you under from others? Which ones are from yourself? Is this lifestyle in any way wrapped up in your sense of self worth and identity?
• Getting a birds eye view on the context of the anxiety is the best way to make the best choices for you about how to improve things. If you don’t have a therapist to do this with, take a big piece of paper and start answering some of the questions in this caption to get you started.

What does it even mean anyway?
The recognition that some people experience more sensitivity than others is based on decades of research by psychotherapist Elaine Aaron. But it is crucial to point out that this is not a clinical diagnosis. It is not a disorder that needs changing. You are not flawed in any way. But it’s common for highly sensitive i individuals to feel that way, because people vary greatly in how much their nervous system is aroused in the same situation. So the signs of a highly sensitive person is a description of variation in individuals that can cause us problems if we don’t account for it. 

Sensitivity can have a positive impact on your life as well as negative. Here’s a few examples below:
 You are likely to be highly conscientious and able to concentrate deeply.
You might be especially good at tasks that demand accuracy and speed and detection of error.
You are more likely to be able to process material at a much deeper level.
You might benefit from an ability to reflect on your own thinking and experience and developing self-awareness.

When it comes to working around the negative sides of high sensitivity, I highly recommend Elaine Aaron’s book, The Highly Sensitive person. (For her book on this see the link in my bio under recommended books)

The pain of loneliness causes us to block it out by putting other things in the way, often without conscious awareness. We start to fill all the quiet moments when loneliness might creep in. We buy more stuff that we don’t need, eat more food that we don’t need, mindlessly scroll online or numb the brain with hours upon hours of tv. More below  

My new book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? covers how to deal with painful emotion. It’s currently half price at £7.50 or if you don’t fancy reading it I can read it for you - download the audiobook for free with audible link in bio.

The key to working out what pains these actions are covering up, we only have to remove them for a short time. The discomfort can arise very quickly when we simply try to still the mind and be present. Sounds easy but for many it can be highly aversive and lead to a swift return to the safety behaviours that make it all go away (for now). I cover in detail how to sit with that discomfort using mindfulness and self-reflection to better understand what is feeding those behaviours.

• Start educating yourself on the various ways you can help yourself and begin putting what you learn into action.
• Talk to someone you trust. Good quality human connection is more powerful than any of us give it credit for.
• Speak to a professional. They can help you consider your options and support you through your recovery.

Feel free to share ??

• You don’t have to start with something overwhelming. Pick something that feels challenging but manageable.

• If you can stay in the feared situation for as long as possible your body will habituate to your environment and calm over time.

• During that time use self-soothing skills to help you through it. 

• The more you repeat a behaviour the more it becomes part of your comfort zone. 

• Allow fear to be with you. Don’t push it away.

• Avoidance is the number one thing that feeds anxiety and makes it worse over time. So if there is something that you want to master but it makes you anxious, do it as often as you possibly can.

• Learn how to use basic skills to calm the mind through the body (see book for detailed description of this).

What is that thing you’ve been avoiding because it makes you anxious?

There is no end point to grief. It does not get any less painful to be without your loved one. But your strength to hold it grows as you build your life around it. This is one of the most helpful ideas on grief that I often refer to for both my clients and myself. I think it allows us to be respectful to the intense pain of grief while offering hope for the future. 

I devoted a whole section of my book to grief because nobody gets a free ride on that one. It is something we all face at some point. So, if you’d like to read more, see the links in my bio. If you don’t feel like reading it I can read it to you as it’s free when you sign up to Audible. Again, all links for that are in my bio. 

For reference this is based on Tonkin’s model of grief. Inspired by a video from @amagiovay"

More below  

• Hold back on using any “I am” statements. One failure is not a conclusive statement about your character or worthiness as a human being. 
• Failure is easier to recover from and learn from when we focus less on trying to prove ourselves and more on trying IMprove ourselves. Each failure then simply becomes an opportunity for learning to inform new efforts.
• Give yourself permission to feel however you feel about it. Allow that emotion to rise and fall before you start looking for learning. It’s much harder to access that rational thinking when emotion is high.
• Commit to having your own back, no matter what. If you work hard at something and the outcome is not what you hoped, you can either continue to hammer your confidence with self-attack or you can show yourself the compassion and encouragement that you would give to someone you love who had the same experience. When loved ones face a fall, we treat them with compassion because we know it’s what they need to give them strength to get back up. So why would you do anything different for yourself?

• It’s not always possible remove all the stress from your life, but when you reach the point of exhaustion, the best way to give yourself a chance of recovery is to reduce stressors where you can.
• This is when the solid back five defenders become crucial. Check in with your nutritional intake, sleep, routine, exercise, nutritional intake and social connection. These are the foundations of good mental health and also the first things we let slide when we’re not doing so great. Making small improvements in these will start to boost your ability to recover from emotional exhaustion.
• Practise listening to your body and mind, asking yourself “what do I need?” And then meeting those needs, even when doing so is difficult to do. For example, it may feel uncomfortable to take time off work if the pressure is on. These scenarios often lead us to ignore the signs that we need time to recover and replenish.
• Never underestimate the power of good social support. Talk to friends. But also spend time with friends that doesn’t involve talking it all through, but is focused on having care-free time out.

?? Feel free to share to raise awareness.
Many people are preoccupied with the question of whether they have depression or not. But the label itself is mostly just a tool for clinicians to easily communicate a group of symptoms. You are the expert on your own experience. So, if you are concerned about your mental health and you know your mental health could improve with some support, then don’t hesitate to seek that support. If professionals are not available to you, trusted friends and family or charity support groups can be a huge boost as you work on recovery. 

It’s also worth noting that symptoms of depression have significant overlap with both menopause and other conditions such as dementia. So always track symptoms over time alongside a professional to help you understand them further.

Sometimes it can cause us to doubt ourselves because we want so much to believe in the words they say.  But when there is a disconnect between words and actions I tend to believe that the behaviour carries more weight.

Despite this I do believe that we should always assume positive intent and not rush to judge someone’s actions as malicious until we know more. As soon as we interpret a situation in that way, we are already disconnected and less likely to be able to approach them in a way that will help us fully understand intent.

I’d love to hear what you guys think on this one, from your own experience.

(It took a few attempts to get the background to change in time)
 It is normal when mood is low to stop feeling the joy that you might otherwise get from activities. As a result, we stop doing them. It starts to feel like too much effort for no real gain. For those in recovery from depression, I often explain that you to need to be doing those things for a while before the joy of doing them starts to return. So, it is worth putting in the effort to do things, for no other reason than you might find them pleasurable.

What are those things that you feel like doing when you’re low in mood, that you recognise will keep you stuck? 

We might get the urge to listen to sad music, avoid social events, put off things we need to do, and generally hide away from the world. But in those moments, here are just a few of the actions that can help you to lift your mood in the moment:
• Moving your body. Doesn’t need to be the gym. Dance around your house, walk the dog. Anything counts.
• Seek out social connection with people you trust. Isolation keeps low mood going.
• Switch up the sad music for something more uplifting that could shift your emotion state.
• Seek out situations that induce a sense of awe. Being in nature can do this for many people. 

What would you add this this list?

Does it happen more with certain people and less with others? Or maybe it happens more when the choice is one that enables you to hold your own needs as equal to others. 

That need we feel to justify ourselves and offer up detailed explanations can be seen as a safety behaviour. An action that helps to bring down the fear associated with holding a boundary. It works temporarily but, in the long term, leads to an increased need to do the same. We find ourselves trapped and unable to hold a boundary if we feel we can’t avoid the disapproval of others.

Maybe asserting yourself in the past led to rejection, abandonment or a complete override of your own needs. Maybe love was conditional. Or maybe it was considered your responsibility to ensure that others remained happy. However the cycle began, it can be broken. It takes time and practise. And it always starts with awareness. So start looking out for those times when you hold a boundary and immediately follow it up with over-explaining and justifying yourself to others.

Is that guilt so intense that you often find it easier to just say yes (when you wanted and needed to say no)? 

Sometimes it makes sense to feel guilty. But sometimes feelings that repeatedly arise and feel out of proportion to the situation, they can be a reflection of the past. So what can we do about it? There is no quick fix to making that feeling disappear. We have to start with understanding the past events that conditioned this response and updating our learning about why the intense guilt comes up and how we want to respond to it as we move forward.

Those people who get to be part of your inner circle. The ones you feel safe to be yourself with. The ones you can share your best and most vulnerable moments with. These people that we connect with deeply are essential to our health and longevity. Good quality relationships show up in the research as the most powerful predictor of a long, healthy and happy life. But they are not the only people we need in our lives. There are many people that play a meaningful role in our lives (as we do in theirs) without ever developing a deep and personal connection. I think recognising the value in the diverse relationships that we encounter is one way to appreciate that each offers us something to learn from and feel grateful for. The aim is not to be left with just the people in that inner circle, but to use boundaries effectively so that we can safely experience a variety of relationships. What are your thoughts on this?

Depression does not always show up in the way you might expect and that can make it difficult to spot. For example if you don’t feel sadness but instead feel numb and lacking in any emotion, this is a symptom of depression. It just doesn’t get so much air time when people talk about how to spot the signs.

It helps to turn toward all these symptoms with curiosity rather than judgement and criticism. Changes in how we feel often indicate unmet needs. Letting go of whether you should or should not feel this way and looking at it as communication from your body and mind about your needs helps us to identify what they are and start meeting them.

The truth is, if you look for someone who has it worse, you will find them. But that does not make your suffering any less valid. Thinking in this way often reflects a lack of self-compassion. If someone you loved unconditionally was suffering in the same way, you wouldn’t hesitate to get them the help they needed. 

The right help is not available for far too many people, for lots of reasons. But if you have access to support, don’t let negative comparison be the reason you hold back from it.

You get so good at holding everything in that nothing seems to phase you. Then one thing catches you off guard and the emotion rushes out uncontrollably. It just keeps coming. Painful emotion is much harder to deal with when this happens. But if we can take time to process life events without bottling them up we not only start the healing process, we also get practise at managing painful emotion along the way.

If you do you’re not alone. I think we do this when we favour intensity over consistency. But if we can commit to a change that is small enough to persist at over time then the gains far exceed that short but intense burst. 

So when you want to make a change, focus less on what the results might be and when they will arrive. Instead focus on creating a process that feels easy enough to do consistently. Once it becomes a part of your everyday routine your brain is great at starting to automate some of that for you so that you don’t have to rely on motivation as much as when you started.

It’s the all-or-nothing thinking, also known as black or white thinking. But looking after yourself does not mean you have to put your own needs over and above everyone you care about. Your needs and theirs are not mutually exclusive. It means we have to start seeing our own needs as equal (in importance) to theirs. This is easier said than done if you have spent your life being taught that your needs are something you attend to only when everyone else is satisfied. It takes great effort to turn the tide on a lifetime of habit. But it can be done. It often demands good support, frequent self-reflection and the facing of a few fears. But the rewards are worth it.

Which of these do you need to start giving yourself permission to do? Sometimes we can hold ourselves back from improving our wellbeing. Here’s a few things that create barriers to optimising our mental health:
• Social pressures. Maybe you feel obliged to stay in a friendship group that is harmful to you. Or maybe you feel pressure to make yourself busy all the time and appear productive when your body is screaming for a rest.
• Misconceptions we have around what it means to seek help and the idea that we need to be in a crisis before we warrant help from professionals.
• Outdated beliefs learned earlier in life that your needs are irrelevant or come last on the list of priorities.

Once we start to acknowledge each of these barriers and see them for what they are, we can start to challenge them and experiment with how good we could feel if we start to place our mental health at the top of our priorities list the way we do with those we love.

Past trauma doesn’t always show up as flashbacks and nightmares. It can also affect you in less obvious ways. For example, anyone can experience the odd outburst of anger, which may be caused by an infinite number of things. But if you notice a pattern that keeps repeating itself, or an intensity of emotion that seems out of proportion to the situation you are facing, these can be a sign that the emotion is not just a reaction to now, but also to the past.

When your threat response is triggered, you are in survival mode. When your brain senses that you might not be safe, speed is more important than accuracy. So your brain does a great job of anticipating threats and jumping to conclusions in order to keep you safe. This means your brain is not taking the time to consider all potential perspectives. It skips all that and takes a short cut to the ideas that could help keep you safe (if that is needed). This speed of processing and a focus on safety leads to bias. We can’t stop that bias. But we can take the power out of it by familiarising ourselves with the types of bias to look out for and naming those thought biases when we notice them. Then we can be open to considering alternative perspectives. Below are a few thought biases that come up with anxiety:

Personalising - this is when we take an ambiguous situation and assume it’s about us. E.g. my friend didn’t wave back. She must hate me.

Catastrophising - when your brain offers up the worst case scenario that hasn’t happened yet and plays it out for you like a movie on repeat, triggering more anxiety.

Spotlight effect - this when we overestimate how much other people are judging us negatively. Something we all do, but do more of when we are anxious.

The ink disappeared just in time  Here are some top tips for dealing with painful emotion ??

?? Feel free to share @drjulie 

• Get to know what your blocking behaviours are. These are the things we do, often without even thinking about it, to numb ourselves. For example, sometimes the first sign of emotional pain is that you are hinting through the fridge for something sweet, or you put off everything else to binge watch tv. Once we build our awareness of how we numb, we can more easily spot when we are struggling.
• It seems counterintuitive to think about welcoming all emotions because our instinct is to push them away. But when we turn toward emotion with curiosity, we no longer need to waste energy fighting it.
• Turning towards it means allowing it to be here. To feel the sensations it brings. And to soothe ourselves as it passes.
• Self-soothing can be anything that helps you to feel safe and comforted  in the moment, without costing you dearly in the long term. 
• Finding words to describe how you feel no writing it down is a helpful way to get some distance from it and see emotions for what they are; an experience washing over you that is temporary.

What else would you add to these? Share with me in the comments what you wish everybody understood about depression.

Nobody can know these things until they know, so these conversations about mental health are helping to squash some of the old misconceptions that were once widely held. Those misconceptions can hold people back in their own recovery. They can also hold people back from being able to support in the most effective way. 

Here are some more tips for how to support someone with their mental health:

* It’s ok if you don’t know how to talk about the painful stuff. You don’t have to be a therapist to be a great support. For example, distraction from your own distress by chatting with a friend can be just as helpful.
* If you are not sure what is the right thing to say, tell them. Let them know that you care about them and want to help, but have no idea how. Ask them what support would be most helpful to them right now.
* Try to help in ways that promote recovery rather than hinder it. For example, if your loved one is managing to cook for themselves, join them but don’t take over the activity. Taking a break from something can make it harder to go back to it. Instead, help like offering childcare while they go to therapy or a doctor makes working on recovery easier.

??Take action. You cannot convince yourself to be more confidence by simply thinking or talking about it. Your brain learns through experience, so the more you do something, the more confident you become.

??You don’t have to start with the most scary thing. Start small and build over time. Consistency wins over intense but one-off experiences.

??To build confidence we must improve our relationship with failure. Recognise that mistakes are not who you are as a person. They are a learning experience. Separate them from your self-worth so that you can use that learning rather than sink into self-loathing.

You get invited to a social event and the anxiety starts to build. As the event gets closer you can’t stop thinking about it and as the anxiety increases so does that urge to avoid the party altogether. You decide to cancel and instantly feel a sense of relief. Phew! You don’t have to face the world today. You then enjoy the calm of staying in your comfort zone until the next time you have to face groups of people and the cycle begins all over again. 

When we break this down in therapy you can start to see the ways you can break the cycle and rebuild your confidence around people. Below are a few thoughts on this:

Avoidance gives you that instant relief but feeds the anxiety in the long term. Going against that urge to avoid the feared situation becomes the big challenge of therapy.
Escaping the feared situation too early, before the body has calmed, also maintains the anxiety in the long term because it reconfirms the belief that you can only feel safe once you escape.
You don’t have to face the most feared situations first. When you do that you are more likely to be overwhelmed and give up. Start with something that feels a challenge but manageable.
Get support from family, friends or a therapist. Having good quality support greatly improves the chances of success.

Here’s a few tips below:

• It’s ok not to talk about the problem every time you see them. For example, if someone is grieving it can be a welcome relief to spend time being distracted by a friend for a while. 
• If you are talking about their problems, ask open questions that require more than a yes or no answer. For example, instead of “Are you ok?” Try “what are you thinking?” 
• Support in ways that help them toward their recovery. For example, giving them a lift to a therapy appointment, rather than taking something off their hands that they are already managing.
• If you are the main cater or support for someone it’s ok to get support for yourself too. If you look after yourself you will be much more able to sustain a good level of care.

Which one resonates for you? 
When someone you love has depression it’s normal to feel confused about how best to help and support them. You fear getting it wrong and making things worse. 
Here’s a few tips below:
• Don’t expect yourself to be the therapist. Nothing is more powerful than a friend you can rely on to keep calling in and spending time with you even when you’re not at your best.
• If you’re not sure the best way to support your loved one, it is ok to ask. Let them know you love them and want the best for them and how important it is to you to be able to support them. Then ask them what kind of support they need. That takes the guess work out of it for both of you. 
• Prioritise your own health too. It is not selfish. It is the only way you can continue to care for others in the long term. It’s ok to get your own therapy to help you along the way. 
• If you struggle to talk about things, it’s ok to be that friend who offers some distraction from how they feel for a while. Do what you can to show them you care.

• Do not wait to feel confident before starting that thing you want to master. It won’t arrive spontaneously.
• Action builds confidence over time. 
• Rather than big, one-off actions, go for consistency over intensity. Repetition that you can sustain is crucial for building confidence.
• You don’t have to overwhelm yourself. Start small and manageable in the stretch zone where you make most progress with performance. 

The model in this video is adapted from Karl Rohnke's Comfort, Stretch and Panic model, which was developed based on the Yerkes-Dodson law. This law posits that peak performance happens when people experience a moderate amount of pressure.

Do you try to say no and then backtrack if the other person shows disapproval? It’s not easy to hold ground if we are used to prioritising the wishes of others over our own needs. We start to question our original decision and convince ourselves that this time we can dismiss our own needs. But when that happens over and over again, we start to lose sight of how and when to respond to our own needs. 

A big challenge that comes with breaking that cycle, is tolerating the discomfort of disapproval from others. Not easy. One way to do that is to stay closely connected to the reasons for holding that particular boundary and your values that is based on. Even choices that seem small can be a significant part values that you’re trying to live by, so keep in mind the reasons they are important to you, even when others may not agree.

One reason this can happen is that we give more than we can sustain, feel exhausted and look to the other person to do something similar in return. When they don’t, we feel resentful. Then the people pleaser in us says, “If I just try harder…if I am more productive, more caring, more helpful, more beautiful, more everything…then they will do the same and I will feel more worthy, more loved.”

If the other person still does not respond, we go round the cycle again and resentment continues to build. 

But what if we were to reflect on those feelings with curiosity? To get honest with ourselves and ask, “what are my needs?” and then commit to taking responsibility for meeting them. Doing this work within the self can break the cycle of resentment and shift the dynamics in a relationship. So nurturing the self is nurturing your relationship.

What is more important to me is that when your body is sending you signals that all is not ok, that we don’t brush it off, but listen to it. All those signs from how we feel in body and mind have something useful to tell us about what we need, and which of those needs are not being met. So if you are ever asking yourself, “Could I be depressed?” It undoubtedly means that your mental health could do with your attention.

This video was the creative inspiration for the shoot. Since learning about kintsugi it has become a key concept that I hold onto personally.

It reminds me that healing is not about pretending the worst never happened. By doing the work to heal, we can find new learning, new strength and new meaning from the hardest of seasons. 

More and more, I see courageous people online sharing their stories of recovery from hardship with the aim of helping others. To me, this is Kintsugi in practice. The more these difficult conversations happen, the more we learn as a society that psychological injury is a part of life. The more we learn that it can be a pivotal part of the story, but doesn’t have to be the end of the story. With healing and recovery we can find new beauty and meaning in life.

This applies to relationships but also goes beyond that. Maybe you stay in a job you hate and live for the weekend. Or live an unhealthy lifestyle and work to exhaustion so that your annual holiday becomes recovery time rather than anything more. Someone I know well always used to say, “It’s not what you eat between Christmas and New Year. It’s what you eat between New Year and Christmas.” I think that rule makes sense for all our actions when it comes to our health and wellbeing. If you change your everyday life, you change your life. 

What is one daily habit change that could make a positive difference to your life?

The reality of that is much harder, especially if those difficult relationships are with your family, spouse or other loved ones. You don’t want to end the relationship altogether, but you recognise that it is causing you emotional pain or even damaging your mental health. In those situations, putting in some boundaries can help to improve the relationship and your own wellbeing.

If setting boundaries in relationships is a new thing for you then therapists can be hugely helpful for this. The task is to carefully work out what boundaries will help you to sustain the relationship without it damaging your mental health. For some, that might be setting rules around how often you see them or how much time you spend together. For others it may be practicing the art of saying no. It can be a real struggle to be assertive or express our own needs in relationships in which we feel a sense of duty. So taking time to get clarity on the relationship in therapy can be life changing."

Who can relate? You can talk for hours to friends but the idea of going to therapy fills you with fear. If that is you, here are a few tips from me, a Clinical Psychologist who has supported countless people through that first therapy session:
• The majority of people walk into their first session feeling nervous and unsure how to articulate everything they want to say. The majority of people then walk out feeling calmer and more hopeful and inspired for their therapy journey.
• The therapy room often becomes your sanctuary. The one place you can go to and express yourself unapologetically, knowing you will not be judged. 
• It’s normal to worry that your story may shock the therapist. But it’s almost impossible to shock a therapist. 
• You cannot cover everything in the first session. Your therapist does not need you to explain everything in a specific order or with absolute clarity. They will take notes if they might need to come back to something later.
• If you feel nervous or fear judgement, say it. Tell the therapist how you feel and they will help you to understand and work through it. That is what they are there for.
• Take all your fears with you and see if therapy could help you change your life. I’m rooting for you!

Is the other person using your emotions to get what they want? Emotional manipulation can be very subtle and hard to spot. But when it becomes pervasive some of the telltale signs can be feelings of confusion about how you keep overriding your own knowledge, instincts and values when making decsions. Increasing self-doubt and uncertainty in your own judgement leads you to give even more power to the other person. Once you start to notice when this is happening, there is opportunity for change. Starting to put in new boundaries with someone who has previously had full control in a relationship is not an easy process. So getting support from a trusted friend or therapist to help on that path is often a good idea. If anyone would like me to do a video on how to start holding boundaries, let me know in the comments.

When we feel this way the most natural response is to look outward, to others, for their idea of what we should be. But this means the goalposts are constantly moving and we are at the mercy of whoever happens to be around. 

It is normal, healthy behaviour to adapt how you behave around different social groups. But if your sense of self-worth is entirely dependent on the opinions of others you are handing over control of your wellbeing to other people. 

One of the remedies for this is to get clarity on your own values. Try spending some time answering some questions like these, to start building a sense of what matters to you from the inside out:
• What kind of person do you want to be? 
• How do you want to contribute to your family, community and the world?
• When tough times hit, how do you want to approach problems? What attitude could you take that would make you proud?

Who else thinks of the worst case scenario before any other possible outcome? If you do, it’s because you are human and your brain does such a great job at keeping you alive. But not every situation that triggers anxious thoughts is life threatening. And those thoughts are your brains attempt to be alert to the possibilities. They are not concrete predictions of what will happen. So learning to step back from catastrophising thoughts and see them for what they are, is an empowering life skill that can give you back a sense of control from periods of anxiety. 

I started this video with, “How to get rid of catastropising thoughts”, because it’s a question I get asked a lot. But, in reality, you never get rid of them. You wouldn’t want to. But they help you to choose which ones you act on and which ones are not helping you. For example, as I walked on a coastal path with my children, my youngest ran towards the edge. Despite the fact that we were a long way from the edge, I was able to grab him and prevent a more dangerous situation because my brain had already played out the worst case scenario for me. A very useful catastrophising thought. But when my sister is travelling to see me and I catastrophise that she could be in a traffic accident, these thoughts are no use to me as it’s a situation I cannot control. They will only serve to make me anxious and change nothing about the outcome.

Be willing to walk alongside them through their struggles and you will already be helping more than you know.

Tackling self-doubt demands courageous action in the direction of something that matters to you, something that feels so important that it overrides your need to feel comfortable and ready. 

When you stop waiting for self-doubt to disappear, when you make this radical decision to let that self-doubt come along for the ride, as you do that scary thing, it won't hold you back anymore.

 I see a lot of misinformation on social media about self doubt and how to tackle it. So I put a few of those into this video.

There is no end point to grief. It does not get any less painful to be without your loved one. But your strength to hold it grows as you build your life around it. This is one of the most helpful ideas on grief that I often refer to for both my clients and myself. I think it allows us to be respectful to the intense pain of grief while offering hope for the future. 

I devoted a whole section of my book to grief because nobody gets a free ride on that one. It is something we all face at some point. So, if you’d like to read more, see the links in my bio. If you don’t feel like reading it I can read it to you as it’s free when you sign up to Audible. Again, all links for that are in my bio. 

This model is covered in my book but for reference this is based on Tonkin’s model of grief. Inspired by a video from @amagiovany

What does anxiety make you do? Everyone responds to high anxiety in different ways but the key factor that all of those actions have in common is that they work (in the short term) to bring some relief from the anxiety. For example, when you go back and triple check the door is locked you get this small moment of, “Phew! All is safe.” But the reason we have to keep going back to check more than once is because that moment of relief doesn’t last long. 

In contrast, the things that will help us address anxiety in the long term tend to be those things that force us to sit with the anxiety in the short term. Not easy. Not comfortable. But definitely possible and definitely worth it.

Share for Mental Health Awareness Week 2022. Conceptualising our mental health in this way holds everyone back. It reinforces the stigma associated with any fluctuation in our psychological wellbeing. It also creates a sense of hopelessness in those who experience a period of mental health problems. So if there is one important message to spread this mental health awareness week it is this. Nobody is immune from changes in their mental health. We are all constantly moving along a spectrum. But the potential for moving toward being unwell also means there is potential for moving back in the other direction back towards wellbeing and good health. There are lots of ways to do that and they all involve committing to do the best by yourself and putting in some work.

Shall I post a few outtakes from this video? Let me know in the comments! We all get overworked and tired every now and then but burnout is more than tiredness. Burnout is when stress becomes chronic and has a detrimental effect on other areas in your life. 

Signs of burnout include chronic exhaustion alongside restlessness and trouble sleeping, poor self-care such as diet and exercise. Other signs include repeated emotional distress, such as anxiety, low mood, or anger outbursts. You may notice your performance at work is going down, while you feel you are working harder than ever, you may also start feeling disconnected with loved ones and struggle to get along as well as you normally do.
Below are some tips on how to prevent burnout but if you want more on this and how to make stress start working for you, see the link in my bio for my no.1 Sunday Times Bestseller, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It’s currently half price (£7.49) in hardback and free when you sign up to Audible. 
A few tips on burnout:
 Start working out what you can say no to. Often we feel obliged to say yes to every request or opportunity. When our health is in question, it’s a pretty good reason to practice the art of saying no to things that are not an absolute priority.
 Prioritise self-care. Get back to basics because they are the foundations of good mental and physical health. Make sleep, healthy food, hydration, exercise and social time top of your to do list. And don’t underestimate the power of these things to build your resilience.
 Re-think what matters. We are vulnerable to burnout when we are working hard on something that is not in line with our own values. Instructions on this in my book. 
 Get support. If you are worried about your mental health in any way, seeking support from a trusted friend or a professional is key. Human connection is a powerful tool. Use it.

Often when this happens it can be understood by looking at how we learnt to relate to others early in life. The behaviours that helped us get by as children are well practised and habitual. But in our adult relationships they can become less helpful and more destructive. 

I include a chapter on relationships in my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It sits alongside lots of other insights from therapy on how to tackle low mood, anxiety, stress, motivation and grief. It’s currently half price in hardback and the audiobook is free when you sign up to Audible. See link in my bio.

Sometimes it can cause us to doubt ourselves because we want so much to believe in the words they say.  But when there is a disconnect between words and actions I tend to believe that the behaviour carries more weight.

Despite this I do believe that we should always assume positive intent and not rush to judge someone’s actions as malicious until we know more. As soon as we interpret a situation in that way, we are already disconnected and less likely to be able to approach them in a way that will help us fully understand intent.

I’d love to hear what you guys think on this one, from your own experience.

Who else gets that rush of guilt when you have to say no or hold a boundary? Join the club! But that guilt might be more to do with learning earlier in life that the needs and feelings of others always trump your own. That is was your job to keep others happy. Sometimes guilt can tell us that we are not doing the right thing. But guilt is not a fact. Listen to it. Then make your decision  taking into account your needs too.

Tips for people pleasers below 

• Balancing your own needs with those of others is not a sign of selfishness. It is a sign of emotional maturity. When we start to set boundaries, how we frame it in our minds is crucial to help us with the guilt feelings that often come up when we start making changes.
• If you notice that your identity is wrapped up in your care taking roles, this can make it even more difficult to make changes. It’s ok to still have that but there may be room to expand your sense of who you are to include other areas of your life and other skills that you have.
• If you are no longer sure what your own preferences are because you have always deferred to what others want, then it’s time to start experimenting with small decisions and reflecting on your own experiences. 
• Keep reminding yourself that it is possible to say no and still be a good person.

• To build confidence, go where you have none. Be willing to step out of your comfort zone and stay there for a while.
• Repetition is key. The things you do every day become your comfort zone. 
• You don’t have to overwhelm yourself with the most difficult things first. Start with the things that feel small and manageable. Then repeat those things until your confidence grows.
• Reassess your relationship with failure. If you believe that mistakes say something fundamental about who you are as a person, you will avoid failure at all costs by giving up sooner or never even trying.

You don’t have to meet the criteria for depression before you start seeking help. If you know your mental health is dipping, it’s never too soon to start focusing on your wellbeing. And there are lots of avenues to do that. Here’s a few:
• Start educating yourself on the various ways you can help yourself and begin putting what you learn into action.
• Talk to someone you trust. Good quality human connection is more powerful than any of us give it credit for.
• Speak to a professional. They can help you consider your options and support you through your recovery.
• Don’t ignore the signs that your mind and body need attention. The sooner you start to meet your own needs, the quicker you will get back to feeling more yourself.

Trying to block out certain thoughts can cause us more problems than when we let them occur and then pass naturally. The key is in choosing which thoughts we will hold onto and focus our attention on and which thoughts we will not give the spotlight to. The metaphor in this video is one I often use to help describe what we do in mindfulness. You don’t block out or deliberately hold onto any particular thoughts. You notice each one as it occurs and let it pass naturally. During that practise you begin to notice that focusing the spotlight of your attention on a thought encourages it to stick around for longer. While trying to stop a thought from arriving makes them more persistent at trying to get their time in the spotlight. Have you ever tried this? Let me know what you think in the comments.

If you want more insights from therapy see the link in my bio to get your copy of my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It is also free when you sign up to Audible. The link for that is in my bio too.

These are just a few of the factors that can lead to procrastination. For anyone looking for tips on how to overcome it so that you can get on with the things that matter to you, I’ve included a few points below. But for anyone who wants to learn in more depth about how to deal with these normal human responses that can hold us back, see the link in my bio for my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It is about to go into its 20th week in The Sunday Times Bestseller list and still sitting at no.1. If you’d prefer me to read it for you it’s free when you sign up to Audible. 

Points for tackling procrastination:

Turn from the self-criticism to curiosity. So rather than get hard on yourself for it, ask yourself why it might be happening and be ready to get honest with yourself.
If a task feels overwhelming, don’t expect yourself to do it all at once. Break it down into tiny steps that don’t feel so daunting.
Start your day with the hardest task first. 
Start questioning your relationship with failure. Perfectionism makes us afraid to fail which can create a block to progress and risk taking. Learning about growth mindset can help this. Check out my other videos on growth mindset or read more in the book. 
Check that the goal is your own and not someone else’s. Keep connected to why you are working toward this thing to help you over the hump of not feeling like it.

It’s very easy for someone to say that, if a relationship doesn’t work for you, just end it. The reality of that is much harder, especially if those difficult relationships are with your family, spouse or other loved ones. You don’t want to end the relationship altogether, but you recognise that it is causing you emotional pain or even damaging your mental health. In those situations, putting in some boundaries can help to improve the relationship and your own wellbeing. 

For more insights from therapy, check out my No.1 Sunday Times Bestselling book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? (Currently -50% off @ £7.50 inc delivery see link in bio). Filled with insights from therapy about how to deal with real life problems. If don’t want to read it and would like me to read it to you, it’s free when you sign up to Audible link in my bio 

If setting boundaries in relationships is a new thing for you then therapists can be hugely helpful for this. The task is to carefully work out what boundaries will help you to sustain the relationship without it damaging your mental health. For some, that might be setting rules around how often you see them or how much time you spend together. For others it may be practicing the art of saying no. It can be a real struggle to be assertive or express our own needs in relationships in which we feel a sense of duty. So taking time to get clarity on the relationship in therapy can be life changing.

Emotional reasoning might have something to do with it. That’s because the brain is much more likely to use short-cuts (in the form of thought bias) when we are under stress. Emotional reasoning is a biased thought pattern in which we assume, “I feel it, therefore it must be true.” Here’s a few points about emotional reasoning that you need to know:

* Feelings are not facts. They are information and ideas offered to us by the brain as a way to make sense of the world around us.
* Part of the power of any emotion is in how much we believe it to be a true and fair reflection of reality.
* Therefore, is an emotion is not a fair reflection of reality but we are taking it to be so, then we experience distress unnecessarily. 

For more details on this and other thought biases, and how to deal with them get your copy of my number one Sunday Times Bestseller, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? Worldwide and audiobook links are in bio.

Have any of these reasons kept you in a harmful friendship? It’s something that doesn’t seem to get talked about but is an issue that arises in therapy. Maybe that’s because these things are so difficult to talk about unless you are in a confidential space. It’s important to point out that, even if you choose to end a friendship, there may still be a grieving process that you experience if that person was a big part of your life. I talk more about what to expect from grief and how to work through it in my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It is currently sitting at no.1 in the Sunday Times Bestseller list for its 10th week  To check it out see the link in my bio.

The pain of loneliness causes us to block it out by putting other things in the way, often without conscious awareness. We start to fill all the quiet moments when loneliness might creep in. We buy more stuff that we don’t need, eat more food that we don’t need, mindlessly scroll online or numb the brain with hours upon hours of tv. More below  

My new book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? covers how to deal with painful emotion. It’s currently half price at £7.50 or if you don’t fancy reading it I can read it for you - download the audiobook for free with audible link in bio.

The key to working out what pains these actions are covering up, we only have to remove them for a short time. The discomfort can arise very quickly when we simply try to still the mind and be present. Sounds easy but for many it can be highly aversive and lead to a swift return to the safety behaviours that make it all go away (for now). I cover in detail how to sit with that discomfort using mindfulness and self-reflection to better understand what is feeding those behaviours.

Many people who experience episodes of low mood blame themselves. They see it as something they are getting wrong. But if a plant does not flourish, you don’t blame the plant, you make adjustments to the environment to ensure that it meets the needs of that plant. There are many things in our lives that are much easier to adjust and change than our brain chemistry. Feel free to share this video.

For tips on supporting your loved one with social anxiety, see caption below

 It’s ok to not have all the answers. You can be a huge support to someone’s recovery without being a therapist. 
 When things are difficult to understand our brains tend to take a short cut and suggest something before we know any better. That is judgement. Try to hold back on settling with those judgements and instead always focus on trying to understand.
 The best help is always in the direction of recovery. For example, if my friend finds social situations difficult and I suggest we avoid them together, the anxiety is likely to get worse. If I agree to go with them and be a support while they challenge their fears, that is going to help them move forward. 
 Keep in mind that the person who is socially anxious may never pick up the phone to call you or suggest going out. But that doesn’t mean they don’t want to connect and spend time with you. Keep reminding yourself of that if you start to feel hurt by it. But equally, it’s ok to talk to them about that and work out a compromise.

My poor husband  Who did you last compare yourself to and how did it leave you feeling? Inspired or envious? Did you turn it into a plan of action to improve your own life or use it as a weapon of self-loathing? When you hear people tell you to just stop comparing yourself, it’s very easy to say, much harder to do. That’s because we are built to be aware of what other people around us are doing and how it’s working out for them. It’s all part of living in social groups. But never before have we had access to images of other people from across the world. And never before have all those people had access to software that could transform images so dramatically that they are almost unrecognisable from the original. So in our new world, comparison can quickly go from being useful to self-destructive. Keep a close eye on how much comparison you are doing and how it is impacting on you.

More on this in my No.1 Sunday Times Bestselling book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? (Currently -50% offer for £7.50 inc delivery see link in bio).

It is normal when mood is low to stop feeling the joy that you might otherwise get from activities. As a result, we stop doing them. It starts to feel like too much effort for no real gain. For those in recovery from depression, I often explain that you to need to be doing those things for a while before the joy of doing them starts to return. So, it is worth putting in the effort to do things, for no other reason than you might find them pleasurable.

Leave a comment or share to support Mental Health Awareness Week 2022. This year it’s about loneliness. 1 in 4 of us will experience loneliness some or all of the time. The pain of loneliness causes us to block it out by putting other things in the way, often without conscious awareness. We start to fill all the quiet moments when loneliness might creep in. We buy more stuff that we don’t need, eat more food that we don’t need, mindlessly scroll online or numb the brain with hours upon hours of tv. More below  

My new book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? covers how to deal with painful emotion. It’s currently half price at £7.50 or if you don’t fancy reading it I can read it for you - download the audiobook for free with audible link in bio.

The key to working out what pains these actions are covering up, we only have to remove them for a short time. The discomfort can arise very quickly when we simply try to still the mind and be present. Sounds easy but for many it can be highly aversive and lead to a swift return to the safety behaviours that make it all go away (for now). I cover in detail how to sit with that discomfort using mindfulness and self-reflection to better understand what is feeding those behaviours.

Who else finds themselves trying to direct the traffic in their own heads? We hold onto some thoughts, churning them over and over, while we try desperately to block others out. Trying not to think of something is both exhausting and futile, often leading to struggles with intrusive thoughts.

We can take a walk with a friend, hop off the bus a few stops early, or try a new route. If we can combine that with some form of green space on a regular basis it can have a significant impact on many aspects of our health and wellbeing. Time in nature reduces the levels of stress hormones in your body, calms anxiety and lifts your mood. When we combine it with exercise it builds our resilience to stress and makes us more sensitive to feelings of joy and pleasure.

Research shows us that at least 20 minutes in nature each week is associated with good health and wellbeing. But don’t stop there. The benefits seem to peak at between three to five hours outside. So I challenge you to find a way to spend more time outdoors today, tomorrow and the next day.

How will you add into your routine some more time to be outdoors this week?

This happens because your body is trying to get in as much oxygen as possible to fuel the stress response. For some it can feel like you might suffocate but in reality you already have plenty of oxygen in your body. But if you can change that fast and shallow breathing for something deeper and slower, you can prevent the anxiety from escalating. 

One easy technique to try is the one in this video called square breathing. You can find a window or picture frame to help you focus on slowing the breath and counting in 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, out 4 seconds and hold 4 seconds. 

Of course, if the timings don’t fit for you then you can adjust. The main aim is that you slow the breathing down. It can take several minutes so stick with it. Any time that your mind wonders, bring your attention back to counting the breath. Let me know how you get on!

We can’t stop certain thoughts from arriving so we need to focus on how we respond to them. The thoughts we have are heavily influenced by our emotional state, physical state, history and what is going on around us. So the power of each thought is in how much we believe it to be a true reflection of reality. 

If your thoughts are causing you distress, it makes sense to check out why. You can learn to do this with a therapist. But you can also do this using a self-help approach. Love to here from you on this.

When one part of your life starts to impact on all the other parts that matter to you, it’s time to start asking some tough questions and getting honest with yourself. Not easy to do. But it can be life changing and even life saving. 

When we try to stop the things that have kept emotional pain covered up, they can start to come to the surface. So it’s always a good idea to do some work on learning how to manage painful emotion in a safe way. For details on how to do that check out my No.1 Sunday Times Bestselling book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? (Currently -50% off @ £7.50 inc delivery see link in bio).

Always seek support from friends, family and local services when trying to tackle an addiction. Support is everything.

Does your inner voice sound more like a bully than a best friend?
There is a reason we show kindness to others when they are hurting or struggling. It’s because that is what they need. Imagine if you were to meet your own needs in the same way that you do for those you care about. 
Everybody wants to thrive and do their best in life. If you are to flourish then you must become your own cheerleader, your own coach, and your own best friend.

Do you judge or disregard how you feel when it doesn’t match what you expect from yourself? I see that happen a lot when people are in pain of some sort. Especially in depression when the most prominent feeling is emptiness and numbness rather than the tearful sadness that you might expect (more below)

When we add judgement to painful human emotion it tends to add to the pain, not take it away. 

It helps to turn toward emotion (or a lack of) with curiosity rather than judgement and criticism. Changes in how we feel often indicate unmet needs. Letting go of whether you should or should not feel this way and looking at it as communication from your body and mind about your needs helps us to identify what they are and start meeting them.

In therapy you will never be asked to face painful emotion without first having some skills to help you soothe your way through that experience safely. If dealing with emotion is high risk for you, always seek the help of a professional who can set you up with those skills. Many of those techniques are also covered in my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It is currently in its 5th week at the number one spot on the Sunday Times Bestseller list. There are signed copies available at both Waterstones and WH Smith. 
Also I managed to get to read the audiobook version which you can pick up for free and keep with the Audible trial (see link in bio).

The mental filter is a common thought bias that happens to us all and has the potential to make us feel much worse. 

If you would like more details on how thought biases are making you feel worse and what you can do about it, I cover this in my new bestselling book. Why has nobody told me this before? (link in bio).

So any time you notice that you are holding onto thoughts that focus on threat and loss like this, don’t let it go unchecked. Notice the bias, label it and take time to consciously consider the other information available to you. These simple tools can be really effective if we put in a bit of practice and use them regularly. Give it a try and let me know what you notice.

Do you judge or disregard how you feel when it doesn’t match what you expect from yourself? I see that happen a lot when people are in pain of some sort. Especially in depression when the most prominent feeling is emptiness and numbness rather than the tearful sadness that you might expect (more below)

???I cover this in more detail in my No.1 Sunday Times Bestseller, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It’s currently on offer at -50% off at £7.50 inc delivery on Amazon. See link in bio to order for UK and worldwide. Also you can download the audiobook (read by me) for free and keep forever (audible trial link in my bio).

When we add judgement to painful human emotion it tends to add to the pain, not take it away. 

It helps to turn toward emotion (or a lack of) with curiosity rather than judgement and criticism. Changes in how we feel often indicate unmet needs. Letting go of whether you should or should not feel this way and looking at it as communication from your body and mind about your needs helps us to identify what they are and start meeting them.

What is your attachment style and how does it affect your relationships in adulthood?

By learning about your own attachment style and the cycles you may get stuck in, you can learn to break those cycles if they cause your relationship problems.

Black and white thinking is a cognitive bias that we all do at times, but we tend to do more of it when we are stressed (more below).

Something small happens and, “the whole day is ruined!” 

This tendency to think in absolutes can make it harder to deal with hurdles because it triggers more intense emotional reactions. If we can only consider something a complete success or a complete failure then we are vulnerable to feeling like a complete failure much of the time. 

So look out for that all or nothing/ black or white thinking. When you notice it appear, call it out. Acknowledge it is a bias that is not helpful. The process of recognising the bias for what it is, will help to take some of the power out of it. Then you can consider alternative perspectives. Give it a go.

There is a chapter on relationships in my new book - Why has nobody told me this before? Available worldwide links in bio.

For example, the natural urge to try and win arguments by proving the other person wrong. The answers to conflict are rarely black and white, so creating a lasting relationship inevitably includes playing with the balance of wanting to be seen as right and wanting to reconnect. This doesn’t mean we should let everything slide. Every conflict is a judgement call and a chance to learn. 

Another is our tendency to expect the other person to anticipate our needs or wants without her communicating them clearly. Voicing our needs can feel highly uncomfortable if we have been taught to squash our needs and prioritise others. But practising this in small ways can be life changing. It not only improves our chances of getting our needs met but also prevents the other person from having to endure the guessing game and suffering the consequences when they get it wrong.

But what if you are engaging in those same behaviours toward yourself? For those who have experienced abusive relationships in the past, we can internalise the voice of the abuser and learn to treat ourselves in the same way, even long after we have escaped the situation. 

1. You blame yourself for everything. You'll make excuses for other peoples behaviour but if you make a mistake you believe it says something fundamental about who you are as a person.
2. You never trust in your own judgement but you see the opinions of others as a much more credible source, so you live in an almost constant state of self-doubt and look to someone else for clarity.
3. You invalidate of ignore your own feelings because you have come to believe that you are oversensitive and overreact, so you don't know which emotions to listen to anymore.

They can also come up for those who prefer to be alone, maybe because the are introverted or socially anxious. For others it might be a result of the pandemic. But we are social beings and so we need to be mindful of when we may be withdrawing so that we can get the support to move back towards human connection in some form. For some that may not be a party or busy social event. It may be a regular catch up with your closest friend or family member. But when it comes to good mental health, human connection matters. A lot.

So I think it’s a great move, when you have a lot on your mind, to make the distinction between things that you can change and things you can’t. One example is the tendency we have to get caught up in other people’s mistakes or choices. It can come from a compassionate place and be rooted in love and concern for another. But if we find ourselves ruminating over these things, it can be less helpful than focusing on the things we can influence, such as our own choices and behaviours. 

So, in a situation that cannot be completely controlled or changed, what matters most to you? Who do you want to be within that imperfect world? How could you conduct yourself in a way that would make you proud and grateful that you made that choice?

Getting to where you want to go is going to mean sitting with some discomfort along the way. But when we get comfortable our energy and motivation to face that discomfort seems to disappear. So we wait. We wait until we feel like moving out of this comfort zone, which of course we never do.

So if you have a goal that has been on your mind for years but you just don’t feel like starting yet, why not start today? Start by shifting the focus of your attention from how you want to feel now, to how you want to feel later. All along the way keep reminding yourself, that the discomfort is temporary, and it’s part of the process. Be willing to step into the discomfort and start moving toward your goals. 

?How are you going to step outside of that comfort zone this week?

The things people are taught in therapy about how to deal with anxiety often seem counterintuitive initially. But over time, become a new way of living that means you no longer have to base your decisions on how you don’t want to feel.

Has anxiety become too much for you right now? If you are struggling with anxiety but don’t know where to start I have put a few tips below  

 Also if you found this video helpful then you will love my new no.1 bestselling book / audiobook - Why has nobody told me this before? I talk  in great detail about anxiety in the book. See link in bio to order for UK, USA & worldwide 

Golden rules for tackling anxiety:
• You don’t have to start with something overwhelming. Pick something that feels challenging but manageable.
• If you can stay in the feared situation for as long as possible your body will habituate to your environment and calm over time.
• During that time use self-soothing skills to help you through it. 
• The more you repeat a behaviour the more it becomes part of your comfort zone. 
• Allow fear to be with you. Don’t push it away.
• Avoidance is the number one thing that feeds anxiety and makes it worse over time. So if there is something that you want to master but it makes you anxious, do it as often as you possibly can.
• Learn how to use basic skills to calm the mind through the body (see book for detailed description of this).

What is that thing you have been avoiding because it makes you anxious?

That is why ice or cold water can be a great tool (more below).

For more help on anxiety check out my No.1 Bestselling book - Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? It is packed with insights from therapy to help everyone boost their mental health. It has sections on anxiety, stress, low mood, emotional pain, motivation grief and more. It is available worldwide (link in bio).

To use ice for grounding, hold the ice in your hands, run it along your arms or face. Notice the sensations. The temperature, texture on your skin. If you are feeling overwhelmed with distress, splashing ice cold water on your face (also know as ice diving) can help to reduce your heart rate while at the same time providing a strong anchor for your grounding technique. This simply means, those strong physical sensations help to bring your attention to the here and now. So, if you tend to get overwhelmed, stock up on ice and give it a try.

If you live in England then the word sorry is something you hear on a daily basis. It can be considered good manners in a variety of situations. But when apologising is driven by more than just cultural habits it can be linked to low self-esteem, shame and trauma.

For more on confidence & self-esteem check out my no.1 bestselling new book ”Why has nobody told me this before?” (worldwide links in bio).

So look out for those apologies today. Notice the impact they have on how you feel. Also notice what feelings come up if you try resisting an unnecessary apology. This can help us to understand what’s going on in more depth. 

Stopping all the unnecessary apologies won’t fix low self-esteem by itself. But it will help. Changing these small behaviours is a significant piece of the larger puzzle. 

I would love to hear all your comments on this

When you make a commitment to work on recovery, it’s easy to get frustrated and self-critical when you have a bad day or a tough week. You may believe that you have gone back to square one. But this is not true. 

Ups and downs are a normal and expected part of recovery. The key is recognising those bad days are temporary and refocus on the skills that you need to get you back on track. You cannot undo the progress you have made and the things you have learned along the way. So keep going!

I have listed below a few of the skills that I used to stay calm and focused and each of them is covered in more detail with step by step instructions in the book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? (Link in bio for USA, UK and Europe).

* I took control of my breathing. I took two short inbreaths for every longer outbreath. This kept my heart rate and all the physical signs of anxiety from escalating.
* I took control of the focus of my attention. I did not allow myself to spent too much time with catastrophising thoughts of what could go wrong (which would only make me more nervous).
* Instead I kept in mind all the times I had faced high pressure scenarios in the past and delivered. 
* While in the interview, surrounded by crew and equipment I knew that distraction could prevent me from fully hearing and understanding a question so I was very intentional about making it a priority to focus exclusively on each question despite everything else going on.
* I reframed my anticipatory anxiety as excitement and entered the experience with the intention of enjoying it, which I did.
* I allowed the stress to be present, knowing that the increase in alertness would help me focus and perform.

So if you have to do something brand new that fills you with fear, don’t let that fear keep you from it. Use all the tools in my book to help you along the way, then enjoy the ride."

 The full and polished version of this video went up on my Instagram yesterday. But I had to share this to show the reality. As with every video, mistakes are made and mess is made (in this case LOTS of mess), but what you see is a few of the best bits that went well. Nobody looks fantastic all the time, says their words perfectly every time or lives life without making mistakes. Life is messy - even if nobody shares it on Insta! 

Enjoy how messy life is today. I hope my messiness put a smile on your face

 More on this can be found in my new book “Why has nobody told me this before?” Link in bio  & worldwide. Also check out the bio link for the audiobook (read by me)

…It reminds me that, no matter how tough things get and how broken we can feel at times, healing can happen. It reminds me that healing is not about pretending the worst never happened. By doing the work to heal, we can find new learning, new strength and new meaning from the hardest of seasons. 

More and more, I see courageous people online sharing their stories of recovery from hardship with the aim of helping others. To me, this is Kintsugi in practice. The more these difficult conversations happen, the more we learn as a society that psychological injury is a part of life. The more we learn that it can be a pivotal part of the story, but doesn’t have to be the end of the story. With healing and recovery we can find new beauty and meaning in life. 

In addition to this, if we can recover once, we can recover again. It gives us all hope that, even when it feel like everything is in pieces, we can get there.

 For more on this see link in bio for my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? Full to the brim with insights from therapy.

So start small. Start manageable. Pick one thing that you know will help in your recovery and double down on it. Don’t underestimate the power of the simple things. Exercise and nutrition are two examples of powerful tools when it comes to tackling depression. Those things can lift mood just enough that you then feel more able to engage in psychological therapies if that is on the agenda. 

If you are ever concerned about your mental health, seek support from trusted friends, family and professionals.

???I see that happen a lot when people are in pain or struggle. 
Especially in depression when the most prominent feeling is emptiness and numbness rather than the tearful sadness that you might expect. 

When we add judgement to painful human emotion it tends to add to the pain, not take it away. 

It helps to turn toward emotion (or a lack of) with curiosity rather than judgement and criticism. Changes in how we feel often indicate unmet needs. Letting go of whether you should or should not feel this way and looking at it as communication from your body and mind about your needs helps us to identify what they are and start meeting them.

@drjulie for all things psychology, mental health and insights from the therapy room.

You get so good at holding everything in that nothing seems to phase you. Then one thing catches you off guard and the emotion rushes out uncontrollably. It just keeps coming. Painful emotion is much harder to deal with when this happens. But if we can take time to process life events without bottling them up we not only start the healing process, we also get practise at managing painful emotion along the way.

Do you find that you can feel lonely sometimes, even though you have people in your life who care? If you struggle with feelings of loneliness, you will know how hard it is to reach out for support. That’s why I am supporting @fournine in their campaign to combat loneliness. They have created a unique website hub filled with interviews from experts on how to cope with and tackle loneliness. They’ve conducted research into the prevalence of loneliness, revealing that 69% of women and 56% of men say they feel lonely at least a few times every year. They also pointed out that this time of year we all feel that extra pressure to push for perfection with big new goals and resolutions. Instead, why don’t we focus our efforts on strengthening our connections with each other?

Follow @fournine and join their New Years Revolution. It’s time to rebel against loneliness!

When we feel painful emotion the most natural human response is to pull away, escape them and avoid. We block them out with anything that feels safe and pleasurable. But when we do that, the painful emotions don’t always disappear forever. We find ourselves trapped in cycles of addictive behaviours that keep the emotion at bay for just a short time. 

The way we guide people to process painful emotion in therapy is to allow the emotion to be there, turn towards it and feel it, while soothing yourself through the process with skills that help you to tolerate the distress. This enables the emotion to take its natural course and wash over you. Emotions come in waves so we know they will increase in intensity, peak and then come back down again.

The winter months can be extra hard for many people. Everything that makes life tough is compounded by the darkness and all the hardships that winter can bring.

 For details on how to get through life’s ups and downs and thrive, or to support someone through tough times, see link in my bio for my #1 Sunday Times Bestselling book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?

So the chances are that someone you brush shoulders with today will be fighting their way through something. It may take all their strength to look you in the eye, smile and say hello. The simplest way to improve the moment for them, or in the very least, not make things worse, is to choose kindness. Every time.

 Any who would prefer an audiobook version it’s currently no1 on Amazon and there is a link in my bio. (I was lucky enough to record it myself )

It’s almost impossible to find a realistic portrayal of a lasting romantic relationship. 

I have a whole section on relationships in my new book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? See link in bio to get your copy 

In real relationships it’s ok to feel bored sometimes and not constantly head over heels. Finding others attractive does not necessarily mean you are in the wrong relationship. Your partners happiness is not entirely your responsibility. You are allowed to hold boundaries and say no. You can disagree, enjoy different hobbies, and spend time apart. 

Observing how people behave in other relationships and talking to friends can help us to work on our own relationship, but comparison is not helpful because we never really get to see what happens behind closed doors so the relationships of others may not be as rosy as we imagine from afar. 

Do you find yourself comparing your relationship to others?

Of course this has nothing to do with apples or cookies and everything to do with those changes that you struggle to make. The apple and the cookie is an introduction to the concept of acceptance in the difficult process of change.This is always a difficult idea to teach as it can be the hardest part of many recovery journeys.

See the link in my bio to order my bestselling new book - Why has nobody told me this before? Packed with insights and tools from therapy to help with life’s ups and downs.

When hard times hit we can confuse acceptance with agreement and approval. But we don’t have to like a reality in order to accept what it is. If we don’t accept reality, we spend a great amount of time and energy fighting against it by avoiding, blocking and suppressing. 

 What does the apple and the cookie represent in your life? Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

What do you dread at Christmas?
If you know that Christmas is a tough time of year for you, then plan to do the best by yourself over the next couple of weeks. The specifics may depend on your situation. But you are the expert on your own experience. So, whatever that looks like for you, commit to having your own back and doing what helps in the long term. Remember that loneliness tells you that you’re alone, even when you are not. And hopelessness tells you to give up when you most need to dig in and try again.

For anyone who feels unsafe over Christmas please please please seek the support you need. Organisations like the Samaritans keep supporting people any time day or night. If you are in the UK you can call 116 123.

If you have ever tried to help someone through a panic attack you’ll know it can be easy to become overwhelmed yourself. You desperately want to say and do the right thing and don’t want to make it worse. So here is just a few simple tools to add to the toolbox for helping someone through a panic attack.

If you have been helped through a panic attack, share with us in the comments what you found most helpful so that others might be helped in the same way. 

 I include a chapter on how to support someone with their mental health in my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? See link in bio to get your copy.

- It’s normal to be nervous
- It’s normal to worry about making sense or getting everything in the right order.
- It’s normal to feel like you have to fit everything into the first session.
- It’s normal that there is never enough time to cover everything.
- Any psychologist or therapist with experience will know all this and be able to reassure you.
- After the first session nerves it gets easier and easier. It won’t take long for the therapy room to become a kind of sanctuary. 

 In my book I talk about when to seek help with your mental health and have filled the book with insights from therapy to help you through day to day life. See link in bio for USA and UK orders.

What does anxiety make you do? Everyone responds to high anxiety in different ways but the key factor that all of those actions have in common is that they work (in the short term) to bring some relief from the anxiety. For example, when you go back and triple check the door is locked you get this small moment of, “Phew! All is safe.” But the reason we have to keep going back to check more than once is because that moment of relief doesn’t last long. 

In contrast, the things that will help us address anxiety in the long term tend to be those things that force us to sit with the anxiety in the short term. Not easy. Not comfortable. But definitely possible and definitely worth it.

My book has a whole section dedicated to anxiety. For your copy, see link in bio.

Research shows that certain behaviour patterns are most associated with relationship breakups. 

Research suggests that contempt is the strongest predictor of divorce. Contempt is more than criticism. It involves attacking someone from a position of moral superiority. Contempt is when we get truly mean. We call them names, disrespect them, ridicule and roll our eyes.

Despite the research, the presence of these behaviours in your relationship does not automatically mean it will end in a breakup. Becoming aware of how damaging these behaviours can be, and noticing when they occur, is the first step towards change.

I cover more in-depth tips on relationships in my book. To get your hands on a copy, see link in bio.

All of the actions in this video are safety behaviours. These are things that we do to feel a little safer in the moment. They are highly addictive because they work in the short-term. They give us that instant relief from the anxiety. Moments later the anxiety returns and increases our need to do the same thing again. That is how rituals and compulsions can build up over time.

More on this in my new book  out now worldwide (link in bio).

Your thoughts, behaviour, and physical state influence how your emotions. They are closely entwined like weaves in a basket so we often experience them all as one and it can be hard to separate them. But when we do, it is easier to establish what we are doing that keeps us stuck and what changes may need to happen if we want to feel different..

Feel free to share/repost this video 

More info...
Any moment in your life can be broken down into these 4 aspects of your experience (there are others, but it’s easier to start with these 4). 
Your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and behaviour are all closely connected. So much so that it can be hard to notice all of them individually. We just notice our one overall experience. But when we practice noticing each one individually, we can build awareness of how they impact on each other.

Most people can tell you which feelings they have that they want to change. But we can’t just magically change how we feel. However, we have more power over our emotions than most people think. Each of these 4 aspects of our experience impact on each other so heavily that if we start to change some of them, the others start to change too. 

A great exercise to try is to draw out the 4 squares (it doesn’t have to resemble a hot cross bun like this one). Bring to mind one moment in time and see if you can write down what your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and behaviours were. It is also great to then do the same for a positive moment when you felt at your best. 

In particular, take note of the three boxes that you can influence. For example, when you felt at your best, what was the focus of your attention? What did your thoughts sound like? What were you doing? How does that compare to the more difficult moments?

• Grounding - when anxious our minds tend to be worrying about something that may or may not happen in the future. You can use each of your senses to ground you in the here and now. Fidgets are a popular choice but it can be as simple as holding onto the desk in front of you or pushing your feet into the ground and noticing the sensations on the soles of your feet. Anything that helps to you to focus on the here and now.

• Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR). You can find guided PMR meditations online. Let me know in the comments if you’d like me to put one on my YouTube channel for you. It involves tensing each muscle group and releasing. Can be very helpful with relaxation after a tough day.
• Breathing - a powerful and fast acting technique for calming anxiety. Focus on taking longer and deeper breaths as breathing becomes fast and shallow under stress. Try to make the our breath longer than the inbreath. A great technique to use when in public as nobody even needs to know you are doing it. 

My new book is packed with tips like this, not only for anxiety, but stress, low mood, grief, motivation and relationships. Link in bio to order

If we could just decide to think something different and then everything would be ok. Then my job wouldn’t exist. So here are a few key points on stress taken from my book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? 
• Simply reducing stress in your life is not the only answer. Most people don’t get to choose the stressors they have to face.
• Some stress is beneficial. It helps us stay alert, focus and perform at our best.
• Stress is useful in the short-term. But when it persists for long periods and we don’t have a chance to recover then it becomes chronic and damaging for our health.
• Finding ways to lean out of the stress and replenish does not have to be a big event like a holiday. Creating small moments of rest each day can be a big help.
• Instead of catching up on emails between meetings, take 10 minutes to walk around the block or sit in your car and close your eyes. Then you will be more able to take on new stress in the next meeting.
• Take back those small, in-between moments in your day when you might otherwise be checking your phone. Resist the urge to fill the time and recognise the potential for a little replenishment.

By book covers a more in-depth look at how we can deal with stress. See link in bio

Do you dismiss how you feel when it doesn’t match what you expect from yourself? I see that happen a lot when people are in pain or struggle. Especially in depression when the most prominent feeling is emptiness and numbness rather than the tearful sadness that you might expect. 

When we add judgement to painful human emotion it tends to add to the pain, not take it away. 

It helps to turn toward emotion (or a lack of) with curiosity rather than judgement and criticism. Changes in how we feel often indicate unmet needs. Letting go of whether you should or should not feel this way and looking at it as communication from your body and mind about your needs helps us to identify what they are and start meeting them.

We have to get the message out there that some of the simplest changes in lifestyle can lead to powerful changes in how we feel. Exercise is one way to start influencing how you feel.

 Behind the scenes coming soon! 
A massive thank you to @gymshark for sponsoring this video and helping us spread the word that moving your body on the daily can have a 
life-changing impact on mental health.

The stress response is there to help us move and meet the demands of our environment. So some stress helps us perform. But repeatedly triggering the stress response without allowing for replenishment in between is like driving your car in second gear along the motorway. At some point it’s going to do some serious damage. 

There is much advice out there telling us to eliminate stress from our lives. But that is not realistic as most people face huge stressors that they can’t control. When that is the case, we must prioritise our natural defences: •exercise
•sleep
•nutrition
•social connection

They seem like the basics, but they are the foundations for good health that strengthen you to face whatever life throws your way. 

So on World Mental Health Day help us spread the message that simple things go a long way.  Feel free to share and repost this message

If you do here are a few insights from therapy.
* Ruminating about things in the past is associated with low mood and depression. But if there are memories that still affect you, returning to them in a new way to try and make sense of them may be necessary. 
* Worrying about everything that may or may not happen in the future is not the same as planning for the future you want. 
* Write worries down and then look at which of those can be prevented by some sort of reasonable action. If they are worries about the uncontrollable then focus on redirecting your attention to the here and now.
* Learning about mindfulness is a helpful way to build your ability to choose where you focus your attention. A worry about the future or a painful memory may still pop up. But you get to choose whether you stay with it and churn it over, or whether you let it go and come back to the present moment.

What helps you to turn the dial down on overthinking?

Then you’re not alone. 

It’s time we start giving mental health the same respect that we give to physical health. Both are a part of being human. Who agrees with me on that one?

One day we will be able to talk about visiting our therapist as openly as we talk about GP appointments. Until then I will be here reminding everyone that mental health problems are a normal part of being human, just like physical injury, and deserve the same respect and care.

See below. 
The tendency to overthink, worry or overanalyse everything can often be related to high levels of anxiety. So addressing that anxiety can have a significant benefit. Start with the simplest things:
* Make extra effort to get enough sleep and get up around the same time each morning.
* Try to address any sugar level imbalances with the help of a dietitian if need be.
* Add in more movement. Exercise helps so find something you might enjoy and do it as often as you can.
* Talk. Sharing some of the things we are worried about can help to quite quickly provide us with an alternative perspective. That is because the friend we talk to may be able to fact check some of our catastrophic thinking. But they also may just share their own ideas, which gives you the chance to see the anxious perspective as just one possible narrative.

* For tips on diffusing from anxious thoughts and letting them go, or thought challenging exercises that are often used in therapy, I cover these in depth in my new book. See link in bio to order yours.

We block them out with anything that feels safe or pleasurable. But when we do that, the painful emotions don’t always disappear forever. We find ourselves trapped in cycles of addictive behaviours that keep the emotion at bay for just a short time. 

The way we guide people to process painful emotion in therapy is to allow the emotion to be there, turn towards it and feel it, while soothing yourself through the process with skills that help you to tolerate the distress. This enables the emotion to take its natural course and wash over you. Emotions come in waves so we know they will increase in intensity, peak and then come back down again. 

How do you manage painful emotion?

It is a term that people often use to describe living with high levels of anxiety while continuing to function in most areas of their life. The wide use of the term may be a reflection of the vast numbers of people who struggle to manage anxiety in everyday life. There are simple ways we can learn to manage anxiety so that we can focus on the things that matter most to us.

The mental filter is a common thought bias that happens to us all and has the potential to make us feel much worse. So any time you notice that you are holding onto thoughts that focus on threat and loss like this, don’t let it go unchecked. Notice the bias, label it and take time to consciously consider the other information available to you. These simple tools can be really effective if we put in a bit of practice and use them regularly. Give it a try and let me know what you notice. 

If you would like more details on how thought biases are making you feel worse and what you can do about it, I cover this in my book. See link in bio to order for UK, USA, and Europe. 

 I think these simple skills should be available to everyone to enhance their well-being so feel free to share / repost with friends or check out my profile @drjulie for more videos like this.

Gaslighting is when one person tries to convince another person that they are wrong even when they are not. Many of us have done this mildly once in a while, but gaslighting becomes more serious when it becomes persistent and extreme. It then becomes dangerous because it starts to erode your sense of self-belief and confidence. It can even cause people to question their own sanity. 

When this starts to happen it can have a huge impact on mental health. So, for anyone who thinks they may be experiencing gaslighting it is essential to start prioritising your mental health. Below are a few tips:
* Keep a private journal. When someone persistently questions your memory or judgement, it helps to have something to refer back to. Write things down, take more photos.
* Talk to people you trust. If you only have one person to consult with and that person is gaslighting then it can be hard to consider other perspectives. Keep talking to friends.
* Speak to a therapist. Not only is this a regular conversation with someone that you trust in complete privacy, but a professional will be able to help you find new ways to respond to the gaslighting and help you find local support to leave an abusive relationship safely if necessary.

Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AWS), also known as Todd's syndrome is a frightening condition in which your visual perception is altered. It can cause objects to appear smaller, bigger, closer, or farther away than they really are. Some people seem to report similar sensations when they have been physically unwell or when they were growing up.

It is not often talked about so this might be useful and might help someone to speak up about their experiences. Always speak to a medical professional for advice.

If we feel fear and move forward toward what matters most to us, that is courage. But courage doesn’t mean you have to face every fear you’ve ever had or put yourself in danger just for the sake of it. It means doing what it takes to live in line with your values and the kind of person you want to be, even when doing so is more difficult than the alternative. 

What do you say no to out of fear? What does it cost you? Not in money but in being able to live in line with the sort of person you want to be. 

To build confidence, embrace that fear, take it with you. Be willing to go where you don’t feel confident and stay there until you do.

But I have seen the same problems occur beyond the scope of paid employment. For example, people who take on caring roles for loved ones are vulnerable to the emotional exhaustion seen in burnout. 

Burnout happens when the demands placed on you have far exceeded what you are able to fulfill for a long period. This leaves you feeling emotionally drained, physically exhausted and run down. It can start to affect your mental health, physical health and relationships and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. 

What are your top habits for preventing burnout?

• Our ability to force ourselves to do things we hate is limited.
• When setting any goal make sure it is based on what matters to you, not what you see others doing or think you should do. 
• Be clear on why you are doing it. Write down why it is so important to you and keep coming back to it.
•When you hit hurdles or get off track (which you will) respond to that with compassion and honesty, not criticism and self-loathing. Failure is a normal part of change, not an indication of personality faults. Change is hard because you’re human. 
• If you can nurture your ability to control your attention and actions you increase chances of sustaining change. 
• Enough sleep is essential for your brain to exercise control rather than act on impulse. So switch your phone off and go to bed.
• Your brain also needs enough good quality food and water for optimal functioning and self-control improves after a healthy meal.
• Meditation improves self-control and enables you to improve the skill of choosing where to focus your attention.
• Focus on what you will do, rather than what you won’t do.
• Slow breathing calms the stress response which improves self-control and reduces impulsivity.
• Exercise also improves self-control and general health behaviours. It restores energy and willpower rather than depleting it as you might think.

If you live in England then the word sorry is something you hear on a daily basis as you go about your life. It can be considered good manners in a variety of situations. But when apologising is driven by more than just cultural habits it can be linked to low self-esteem, shame and trauma.

So look out for those apologies today. Notice the impact they have on how you feel. Also notice what feelings come up if you try resisting an unnecessary apology. This can help us to understand what’s going on in more depth. 

Stopping all the unnecessary apologies won’t fix low self-esteem by itself. But it will help. Changing these small behaviours is a significant piece of the larger puzzle. 
I would love to hear all your comments on this

Lots of insights on self-esteem are in my new book ”Why has nobody told me this before?” Link in bio.

Who can relate? You can talk for hours to friends but the idea of going to therapy fills you with fear. If that is you, here are a few tips from me, a psychologist who has supported countless people through that first therapy session:
• The majority of people walk into their first session feeling nervous and unsure how to articulate everything they want to say. The majority of people then walk out feeling calmer and more hopeful and inspired for their therapy journey.
• The therapy room often becomes your sanctuary. The one place you can go to and express yourself unapologetically, knowing you will not be judged. 
• It’s normal to worry that your story may shock the therapist. But it’s almost impossible to shock a therapist. 
• You cannot cover everything in the first session. Your therapist does not need you to explain everything in a specific order or with absolute clarity. They will take notes if they might need to come back to something later.
• If you feel nervous or fear judgement, say it. Tell the therapist how you feel and they will help you to understand and work through it. That is what they are there for.
• Take all your fears with you and see if therapy could help you change your life. I’m rooting for you!

Feel free to share this video you never know who it could help
September is su?clde prevention month (US) many people might think, what does this have to do with me? What difference can I really make to other people’s lives? But as you go about your day remember that for every human you brush shoulders with and interact with, the chances are that a few of them might be struggling with their mental health. So the way we make a difference is in the quality of those small interactions.
Always choose kindness. Always.
It could shift someone’s day in ways you might never have imagined. 

 How will you spread kindness today?
I would love to hear your stories of when kindness from another person has changed your day.

Sometimes it’s hard to put your finger on what is going on when someone is being passive aggressive. You start questioning your every move and wonder whether you have done something wrong and what it could be. 

But passive aggression is a sign that the other person is not taking responsibility for their own role in the relationship. If they feel hurt or upset by something you have done, a healthy response would be to tell you so that you can work together to resolve things. 

I cover more details on healthy relationships in my book. See link in bio to order for UK, Europe and USA.

A national survey conducted by @sanctuaryspa found that a staggering 94% of UK women have felt the benefits of taking time out to look after their wellbeing and recognise that around 50 minutes a day would be ideal. But the majority of women are only spending an average of 17 minutes a day on themselves. So we have a national self-care gap.

What do we do about it? We can't all go for a massage every day or fit in a yoga class while getting the kids ready for school. We need something that is small enough to realistically fit into our busy lives and big enough to make a difference over time.

In the same way that we aim for our five a day to keep up our fruit and veg intake, I challenge you to 25 a day. Make 25 minutes of protected time every day to do more of the things that nurture and enhance your wellbeing. For some that might be finding a quiet place to rest and recharge. For others it might be walking in nature. Self-care is any action that nurtures your own health and wellbeing.

My 25 a day is going to start with movement, as I have been sitting at the desk far too much recently. What will it be for you? Share with me in the comments how you plan to look after yourself today?

But to change how you feel you don’t have to change your thoughts. You can change your relationship to them. 

We can’t stop certain thoughts from arriving so we need to focus on how we respond to them. The thoughts we have are heavily influenced by our emotional state, physical state, history and what is going on around us. So the power of each thought is in how much we believe it to be a true reflection of reality. 

If your thoughts are causing you distress, it makes sense to check out why. You can learn to do this with a therapist. But you can also do this using a self-help approach. Love to here from you on this.

My book “Why has no one told me this before?”gives more detail on how to change your relationship with your thoughts, see link in my bio to order.

By becoming aware of such patterns we can choose to make new, healthier choices in the future.

For anyone who is trying to tackle anxiety but doesn’t know where to start I have put a few tips below. I also cover this subject in detail in my book. See link in bio to order for UK, USA, or Europe. 

Golden rules for tackling anxiety:
• You don’t have to start with something overwhelming. Pick something that feels challenging but manageable.
• If you can stay in the feared situation for as long as possible your body will habituate to your environment and calm over time.
• During that time use self-soothing skills to help you through it. 
• The more you repeat a behaviour the more it becomes part of your comfort zone. 
• Allow fear to be with you. Don’t push it away.
• Avoidance is the number one thing that feeds anxiety and makes it worse over time. So if there is something that you want to master but it makes you anxious, do it as often as you possibly can.
• Learn how to use basic skills to calm the mind through the body (see book for detailed description of this).

What is that thing you have been avoiding because it makes you anxious?

Sometimes it’s easier to see the problem than it is to pinpoint what we could do to start making things better. We spend time focusing our efforts on wishing things were different. Take 10 minutes to write down detailed answers to the questions in this video and you may just get some clarity on which direction to go. Sometimes we can’t wait for our problems to resolve before we start moving towards a life that brings purpose and meaning. We have to get started in the face of them.

(Full video without the smash) You get so good at holding everything in that nothing seems to phase you. Then one thing catches you off guard and the emotion rushes out uncontrollably. It just keeps coming. Painful emotion is much harder to deal with when this happens. But if we can take time to process life events without bottling them up we not only start the healing process, we also get practise at managing painful emotion along the way.

When we feel low we tend to stop doing all those small things that make us smile or bring a little dose of joy. We don’t feel like doing them and we minimise their importance, telling ourselves that it won’t make any difference. 

Each of those small things add up over time. When times are hard they are even more essential as they offer small moments of relief from everything we face.

I have listed below lots of quick tips from the science and the therapy room on what helps.

• Slow breathing is the quickest way to calm the body. Try to make your outbreath longer than the inbreath. Do this for several minutes.
• Exercise helps the body become more resilient to stress.
• Exercise in a green space is even more effective for improving mental health.
• Talking and listening to others helps us get new perspectives on thoughts that are causing anxiety.
• Social support on a regular basis improves outcomes for our mental health.
• Avoidance feeds anxiety and makes it worse - even though it makes you feel relief in the short term. Face things gradually but frequently.
• Use non-sleep deep relaxation or progressive muscle relaxation to calm the body and mind.
• Look out for thought biases like catastrophising. These make anxiety worse.
• Once you spot catastrophising, label those thoughts. This helps reduce their effect on us.
• Sleep well and eat well. If you don’t have enough rest or nutrition your body and mind will never be at their best.
• Visit a therapist. There are lots of evidence-based therapies that help people every day. 

For more in-depth tools on how to beat anxiety, my book covers a whole range of techniques. To order see link in bio

A quick chat from my bathroom floor to remind you that self-criticism is not the path to more motivation or more achievements. But it is the path to more unhappiness and more struggle. 

Do you you know any elite athletes who hired their worst critic as a coach? No. Because they understand that to be at your best you need honest support and encouragement from someone who has your best interests. Not someone who kicks you while your down. 

Have a great weekend guys. #bekindtoyourself

What has self-doubt held you back from? Don’t wait for self-doubt to disappear before you take action on things that mean the most to you. If it’s not budging, take it with you. 

When I started studying psychology I was full of self-doubt.

When I started working as a clinical psychologist I was full of self-doubt.

When I started making videos to share ideas from therapy I was full of self-doubt.

When I started writing my book I was full of self-doubt. 

When you allow it to be there, it doesn’t have to hold you back. 
Do it scared.

If you want to learn more about how to tackle self-doubt I cover it in detail in my new book. To order see link in bio  Available in the UK, USA and across Europe.

Nobody looks fantastic all the time, says their words perfectly every time or lives life without making mistakes. Life is messy - even if nobody shares it on Insta! 

Enjoy how messy life is today. I hope my messiness put a smile on your face 

Feel free to share ??

Who can relate? I don’t think anyone says these things to make anyone else feel worse. It’s just a sign that most people have no idea how to help. 

How do you tend to respond to these sorts of comments? Do you try to explain your experience to that person, or end of the conversation and call it a lesson learnt that this is not the person to confide in? 

Let’s discuss in the comments.

I cover lots of tips in my new book on how to support someone with their mental health. See link in bio to order.

The research conducted by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck looked into the profound impact that certain beliefs can have on our lives. 

More specifically, she noticed that those who believe their personality, intelligence and creative abilities to be fixed from birth and unchanging (fixed mindset) were more likely to give up in the face of setbacks, ignore useful feedback, feel threatened by the success of others and avoid challenges that could lead to failure. 

Dweck found that those who set themselves up with a growth mindset (seeing failure not as a sign of permanent lack of ability but a chance for learning and growth) were more likely to persist after a setback, embrace big challenges, learn from criticism and find inspiration in others. 
I often revisit this research as I find it so helpful in my own life to set myself up with a growth mindset when I tackle big things or face setbacks. Definitely check out Dweck’s work!

But understanding how we get stuck in cycles of depression is too important to skip. Nobody chooses depression, but every choice we make, big and small, either contributes to our health or challenges it. Once we are stuck in an episode of depression we are more vulnerable to repeat behaviours that keep us stuck in the long term. This is because depression is painful, producing strong urges to find immediate relief. The things that offer immediate relief keep us stuck in the long term. They maintain depression and feed it, making it worse over time. 

It is very easy to say, “do the stuff that is good for you, even when depression tells you not to” and really hard to do it in real life. So start small. Start manageable. Pick one thing that you know will help in your recovery and double down on it. Don’t underestimate the power of the simple things. Exercise and nutrition are two examples of powerful tools when it comes to tackling depression. Those things can lift mood just enough that you then feel more able to engage in psychological therapies if that is on your agenda.

Reels are too short to do this justice but I go into much more detail on this in my new book. To pre-order see link in bio.

Direct confrontation is not the only way people express negative feelings. When there is a disconnect between what someone says and what he or she does, we start to get that uncomfortable feeling that something is not right. The guessing game begins about how that person really feels. 

Some signs of passive aggressive behaviour can be:

• They may appear to agree but then fail to do what they have agreed on.
• They may frequently complain about feeling unappreciated.
• They may express a cynical or hostile attitude 

What signs of passive aggressive behaviour do you pick up on most easily?

Here is a short version of how I sometimes explain it in therapy. What are your thoughts? 

It can be frightening to even consider psychological therapy for PTSD because it asks you to do the thing you most fear - think about it and talk about it. But no therapist would ask you to face overwhelming pain without first gearing you up with emotion coping skills to help you manage it safely. The right therapy at the right time can be life changing.

Getting to where you want to go is going to mean sitting with some discomfort along the way. But when we get comfortable our energy and motivation to face that discomfort seems to disappear. So we wait. We wait until we feel like moving out of this comfort zone, which of course we never do. 

So if you have a goal that has been on your mind for years but you just don’t feel like starting yet, why not start today? Start by shifting the focus of your attention from how you want to feel now, to how you want to feel later. All along the way keep reminding yourself, that the discomfort is temporary, and it’s part of the process. Be willing to step into the discomfort and start moving toward your goals. 

How are you going to step outside of that comfort zone this week?

The reality of that is much harder, especially if those difficult relationships are with your family, spouse or other loved ones. You don’t want to end the relationship altogether, but you recognise that it is causing you emotional pain or even damaging your mental health.

In those situations, putting in some boundaries can help to improve the relationship and your own wellbeing. If setting boundaries in relationships is a new thing for you then therapists can be hugely helpful for this. The task is to carefully work out what boundaries will help you to sustain the relationship without it damaging your mental health. For some, that might be setting rules around how often you see them or how much time you spend together. For others it may be practicing the art of saying no. It can be a real struggle to be assertive or express our own needs in relationships in which we feel a sense of duty. So taking time to get clarity on the relationship in therapy can be life changing.

It reminds me that, no matter how tough things get and how broken we can feel at times, healing can happen. It reminds me that healing is not about pretending the worst never happened. By doing the work to heal, we can find new learning, new strength and new meaning from the hardest of seasons. 

More and more, I see courageous people online sharing their stories of recovery from hardship with the aim of helping others. To me, this is Kintsugi in practice. The more these difficult conversations happen, the more we learn as a society that psychological injury is a part of life. The more we learn that it can be a pivotal part of the story, but doesn’t have to be the end of the story. With healing and recovery we can find new beauty and meaning in life. 

In addition to this, if we can recover once, we can recover again. It gives us all hope that, even when it feel like everything is in pieces, we can get there.

But the figures suggest we all need to do more. We need to have compassionate conversations about mental health that teach anyone who may be listening that it’s ok to talk about it. We all need to give mental health the same respect that we give to physical health. We also need to increase funding to services that are already doing a great job at providing help. We also need to share education about how we can all take responsibility for our mental health in the same way that we do for our physical health, so that we can put in place preventative measures that help us to stay well and reduce the risk of becoming unwell.

What is your go-to strategy for staying at your best?

Of all the things you give your time and attention to, which of those things nourish your mind and enhance your wellbeing? Which of them deplete you? 

It’s ok to do things that feel less than healthy some of the time. But just like fast food, too much of those things can do some serious damage to your long term health. 

Why not give ourselves the best chance to stay well by guarding our minds from the things that we know make it harder to be happy and healthy in the long term?

What is your McDonalds for the mind? What do you have to restrict?

If you focus on starting small but staying consistent with those small changes, they add up over time. When that small change is repeated enough times it becomes a habit that no longer requires that extra will power to make it happen. Then you can move onto the next small change. 

This example of a flight shifting direction is covered by a few texts on habits, including Atomic Habits by James Clear. I will share in my stories this week some of my favourite books on habit change.

I see so much misinformation on social media about how everyone apparently has the ability to reach their full potential and happiness is no more than a choice. But that presumes that everyone has their basic human needs met.

Back in 1943, American psychologist Abraham Maslow first put forward his theory of the ‘hierarchy of needs’ - the idea that we must meet our most basic needs first, before we can seek our “higher” needs, which enable us to reach our full potential. This is an old model and others have built upon this since, but it continues to be a classic.

His theory was informed by his study of exceptional people such as Albert Einstein. He suggested that Einstein is an example of the healthiest human psychology. 

But, the self-help industry that often claims to sell lifelong happiness, does not account for the fact that you can have any of the bottom 4 layers of the hierarchy pulled like a rug from beneath you at any point. Then a process of rebuilding must begin, before you can feel safe enough and free enough to focus on fulfilling those higher potentials. 

So if you are not there yet, it is not a failure. It means you have needs that are not yet being met. Or maybe the pyramid is out of balance, with too much emphasis on one of the higher needs before you have your basic health and security sorted. It is a process of meeting each of your deepest needs so that you can move on and gradually reach your full potential.

This is always a difficult idea to teach as it can be the hardest part of many recovery journeys.
When hard times hit we can confuse acceptance with agreement and approval. But we don’t have to like a reality in order to accept what it is. If we don’t accept reality, we spend a great amount of time and energy fighting against it by avoiding, blocking and suppressing. 

 What does the apple and the cookie represent in your life? Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

It often involves invalidating one’s experiences, ideas and feelings repeatedly. It might sound like, “You shouldn’t be upset by that” or “you are paranoid” or “I was joking, learn to take a joke”. 

Do you hear any of these on a regular basis?

This is a metaphor often used in Acceptance and Committment Therapy (ACT) to help describe how our attempts to control problems often become the problem. The same goes for emotion. We cannot completely control our emotional experience. But trying to control it can bring us a world of problems. By allowing all emotions to be present, we free ourselves up to understand them and then to use our energy for turning towards the things that matter most in our lives.

But it could be a sign to reflect on a few things and see if the relationship is healthy and fulfilling for you. Most importantly, do you feel safe in the relationship? Safe to be yourself, voice your own opinions, make mistakes and make choices for yourself? If you don’t then seeking support from someone you trust is essential. If you don’t have anyone you trust then there are some incredible charities that can offer support and a safe haven. I have put a couple of uk based charities below for you.

If you want to feel less overwhelmed, there are some simple things you can do that help to release stress, leaving you feeling stronger to face the challenges in front of you.

Some of the most effective stress relievers are the first ones we let slide when we’re not feeling good. But those are the things that help us to maintain some wellbeing in tough times. Whether it be exercise, time with friends, meditation or creative hobbies, these activities are often seen as indulgent. They are, in fact, essential for helping to prevent overwhelm and burnout. 

In therapy, I often ask people to identify which activities help them to feel revitalised the most. Then we create a short list of non-negotiables. The non-negotiables are the actions that need to happen on a regular basis to maintain good mental health. There are certain behaviours that we always make time for because we perceive them as essential for good health, such as brushing our teeth. But when it comes to behaviours that nurture our mental health, our perception of them as indulgent, means they get left off the list when we are busy. What will you put on your list of non-negotiables?

These are just a few of the things that we might notice when we are feeling isolated or disconnected from others. They can also come up for those who prefer to be alone, maybe because the are introverted or socially anxious. For others it might be a result of the pandemic. But we are social beings and so we need to be mindful of when we may be withdrawing so that we can get the support to move back towards human connection in some form. For some that may not be a party or busy social event. It may be a regular catch up with your closest friend or family member. But when it comes to good mental health, human connection matters. A lot.

Do you know where your people pleasing patterns came from? 
How do they make like easier? And how do they make life harder? What does it cost you to always be focused on keeping everybody else happy? 

The antidote to people pleasing is not selfishness. It’s balance and compromise. It’s finding ways to look after you while also maintaining your relationships. It’s not putting yourself first over everyone and everything. It’s bringing yourself up to an equal standing as your loved ones and being there for yourself in the way you are with them.

It shouldn’t be a once-in-a-while treat, but a staple part of our daily routine. We don’t have to climb mountains or hike through jungles to get the benefits of being outdoors. We can take a walk with a friend, hop off the bus a few stops early, or try a new route. If we can combine that with some form of green space on a regular basis it can have a significant impact on many aspects of our health and wellbeing. Time in nature reduces the levels of stress hormones in your body, calms anxiety and lifts your mood. When we combine it with exercise it builds our resilience to stress and makes us more sensitive to feelings of joy and pleasure.

Research shows us that at least 20 minutes in nature each week is associated with good health and wellbeing. But don’t stop there. The benefits seem to peak at between three to five hours outside. So I challenge you to find a way to spend more time outdoors today, tomorrow and the next day.

How will you add into your routine some more time to be outdoors this week?

It’s not always easy if you live in the city. But if you are working on dealing with stress or improving your mental health then add a visit to some green space to your to-do list. Being in nature, even for a short time, can have a positive impact on your mood. Research has even shown that psychological therapies provided in a garden are even more effective than those provided in a hospital setting.

This was a video I made with the BBC to promote awareness of ways we can manage our mental health. Huge thanks to the talented Billy @weareenderley and @bbc

This means problems are rarely separate and disconnected from the different areas of our lives. They are often woven into lots of different relationships and scenarios that make it difficult to sustain positive change. 

Let’s say you developed a problematic relationship with alcohol and you wanted to stop drinking. It is likely to be an overwhelming change to make if the focus is purely on the alcohol. Problematic drinking may be wrapped up in specific social circles or a work culture, or a coping strategy for an unresolved trauma. Spending time on each of those connected problems can help to make progress more sustainable. 

Have you ever started working on other things only to find it helps you with making progress on your original goal?

What about the signs that things are good and this relationship could be a healthy one? 

•When you share some core values with the other person this stands a relationship in good stead.
• When the other person is respectful and welcoming to your friends and loved ones
• When you feel safe to disagree and express your opinion without it leading to huge problems in your relationship 
• When a good friendship sits at the core of your connection it helps to keep a relationship strong even when romance fluctuates.
• When you both respect each other’s needs and boundaries.

What other green flags can you think of?

A little while ago I posted a video indicating red flags in relationships. Tomorrow I will post a video on the green flags. The good things to look out for and nurture for building healthy relationships 

 As relationships are so intrinsic to our mental health, I also cover them in more detail in my new book which is available now to pre-order. See link in bio.

Plenty of people that you may admire for their confidence will feel some fear or anxiety and definitely some stress when they face challenges. That is because the human brain is providing us with the stress response to help us perform and stay alert. Or maybe fear is helping us to avoid something that might be harmful along the way. You can feel all of that and still feel confident that you will give something your all.
You can still feel confident that you are doing the right thing.
You can still feel confident that whatever the outcome, you will have your own back and dust yourself off ready to try again at this thing that matters to you.

But those things tend to keep us stuck in the long term. 

Let’s say you’re in a supermarket and you start to feel the pounding heart and sweaty palms. You recognise this to be anxiety and the urge is to get out of there as quickly as you can. When you do the anxiety subsides and you feel a sense of relief that you have decided not to face it today. 

That relief may last until the next time you need to go back to the supermarket. When you do, the anxiety response might be even worse because escaping the situation before your body had a chance to calm has reinforced the association your brain makes between the supermarket and danger. Your brain never got the chance to experience remaining in the supermarket and calming over time. 

What situations trigger anxiety for you and that urge to escape?

But something that original advice misses out, is how we treat ourselves. The boundaries we set and keep for ourselves communicate to others what is acceptable and what is not. This can be incredibly hard to do if we have been taught to diminish our own needs in favour of everyone else’s.

Many people show great compassion to others but don’t include themselves. Many people do not see themselves as worthy of receiving such kindness. Or perhaps they accept disrespect from others as they do not feel deserving of anything more. 

Why not try it today? Treating yourself with the same love, care and respect that you give to others? Let me know how it goes!

Our own ideas about how we are perceived by others used to involve a lot of guess work, but for many taking part in the online world it is clear that people express fleeting negative judgments and verbal attack in a way that they wouldn’t in a person to person conversation. So anyone expressing themselves online is more vulnerable to negative judgment. 

In addition to that, the colossal explosion in both highly filtered, face and body distorting images and the fierce marketing of cosmetic surgery and fillers to create such a familiarity that they all appear to be a part of ‘normal’ life, the following stats that are popping up in research start to make sense:

• over 1/3 teenagers felt upset and ashamed in relation to their body image.
•over 1/3 adults reported feeling depressed because of their body image.
• 19% of adults say they feel disgusted by their appearance.

One caption is not enough to break down the complex issues surrounding this. But one way that we can all play our part is to remember that behind every post online is a real human being. 

If you wouldn’t have it written on your t-shirt, don’t write it online. 

Do you feel that your perception of yourself or your appearance has been influenced by the online world?

Please feel free to share. You never know who it may help today 

When life throws you a curve ball and your mental health starts to suffer, your mind can convince you that you are the only one. 

In reality, one in four of us will experience a mental health problem at some point in our lives. So whether you are surrounded in friends, family or colleagues, the chances are that someone will be struggling with their mental health. While fluctuation in mental health is a normal part of being human, not everybody recovers.
Across the world, we lose one person every 40 seconds to suicide. So be kind. Always..

Black and white thinking is a cognitive bias that we all do at times, but we tend to do more of it when we are stressed. Something small happens and, “the whole day is ruined!” 

This tendency to think in absolutes can make it harder to deal with hurdles because it triggers more intense emotional reactions. If we can only consider something a complete success or a complete failure then we are vulnerable to feeling like a complete failure much of the time. 

So look out for that all or nothing/ black or white thinking. When you notice it appear, call it out. Acknowledge it is a bias that is not helpful. The process of recognising the bias for what it is, will help to take some of the power out of it. Then you can consider alternative perspectives. Give it a go ??

Sometimes our efforts to control things that cannot be controlled keep us stuck and become the problem. 

This is especially true for painful emotions. Trying to keep them under tight control appears to be the way forward until we find ourselves consumed with maintaining that control to the detriment of the other aspects of life that matter to us.

We all get overworked and tired every now and then but burnout is more than tiredness. Burnout is when stress becomes chronic and has a detrimental effect on other areas in your life. 
Signs of burnout include chronic exhaustion alongside restlessness and trouble sleeping, poor self-care such as diet and exercise. Other signs include repeated emotional distress, such as anxiety, low mood, or anger outbursts. You may notice your performance at work is going down, while you feel you are working harder than ever, you may also start feeling disconnected with loved ones and struggle to get along as well as you normally do.
If burnout is on the horizon, here are a few things we can do to put on the breaks. 

•Start working out what you can say no to. Often we feel obliged to say yes to every request or opportunity. When our health is in question, it’s a pretty good reason to practice the art of saying no to things that are not an absolute priority.

•Prioritise self-care. Get back to basics because they are the foundations of good mental and physical health. Make sleep, healthy food, hydration, exercise and social time top of your to do list. And don’t underestimate the power of these things to build your resilience.

• Re-think what matters. We are vulnerable to burnout when we are working hard on something that is not in line with our own values. Taking time to think through how you want your life to be, the kind of person you want to be, or the impact you want to have on the world can help to get clarity on how to redirect your life in a way that suits you.

• Get support. If you are worried about your mental health in any way, seeking support from a trusted friend or a professional is one of the best things you can do and your chances of making a full recovery greatly improve. Human connection is a powerful tool. Use it.

It is able to do that so fast that it can set off a series of biological responses in your body before you have even had a chance to think through what is happening. That is function is not an out of date brain system left over from the past. It still keeps you alive today. But the speed of that response means that it can fire off when there are signs of danger but no real danger. It is then up to us to use our conscious mind to think through our situation and decide whether those signs warrant a threat response or whether to get to work calming the body back down to baseline. 

What situations trigger your threat response that turn out to be the burning toast rather than a real fire?

If you were a coach to a top athlete, how would you speak to them after they missed a point, lost a game or failed to qualify? Would you attack their character, call them names, or tell them to give up? 

Of course not. Why? Because they need better than that if they are to pick themselves back up and put everything into trying again. 

Let’s think of our own minds as that athlete. If we expect it to perform well and meet all of those high expectations, we need to nourish it with everything it needs. 

As we head into mental health awareness week, why not make the commitment to call out that unhelpful self-attack every time you notice it and come back at it with something more helpful.

Breaking old habits and establishing new ones is not easy. It doesn’t happen over night. It happens with frequent repetition of that new behaviour until it is such an established part of your routine that your brain can do it almost automatically without too much conscious effort. 

So, when you are trying to make a change, don’t get disheartened if it doesn’t stick straight away. Expect a good deal of conscious effort for a few months. When you get off-track just get straight back on as soon as you can. 

What habits are you trying to change?

This involves making a conscious effort to notice urges and to recognise that we don’t always have to act in line with those urges. We can make a choice to act opposite to the urge. It is far from easy in some circumstances but life changing when it is well-practiced to the advantage of your health and best interests. 

The opposite action is helping for harmful behaviours but also for other things like getting back into the swing of things with regular exercise or building your social contact back up again after being isolated through the pandemic, or getting that piece of work done that has been put off for too long. 

You can practice with small things like holding a mint in your mouth and going against the urge to crunch it. Simple exercises like that can help us to open up to the possibility of acting based on what we want rather than we we feel. 

When are you great at acting opposite and when do you find it more difficult?

So did you notice that it took more time and conscious effort to name the colour when it did not match the word? If you did then this is know as the Stroop effect.

This short clip comes from the longer Stroop test that was originally designed by John Stroop in 1935. 
It was taught as one of the classic psychology experiments back in my undergraduate days and I’m sharing it with you as just one example of how amazing your brain is.

So what is happening? The Stroop effect demonstrates something called cognitive interference. You experience a delayed reaction because the information about the colour of the print and the word does not match up. 
How is this useful? This test can be combined with others to measure a person’s selective attention capacity and their processing speed ability. 
Here are two theories about why it happens:
The theory of automaticity suggests that recognising and labelling colours is not an automatic process so it takes time and conscious effort (maybe because you don’t often need to do this). The brain automatically understands the meaning of words because it is so well practiced at it.

Another theory is selective attention theory. This suggests that colour recognition requires more attention than reading a word, so it takes longer.

I’m sorry but I’ve just got to say this. 
It’s ok to delete the word sorry out of all those sentences that don’t need an apology. If you feel the need to be polite, try swapping the “sorry” for an expression of gratitude instead. For example, instead of “sorry I’m late” try “thank you for your patience”. See how it feels different to be kind without having to apologise for everything.

This simply means, those strong physical sensations help to bring your attention to the here and now. So, if you tend to get overwhelmed, stock up on ice and give it a try.

The research conducted by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck looked into the profound impact that certain beliefs can have on our lives. 

More specifically, she noticed that those who believe their personality, intelligence and creative abilities to be fixed from birth and unchanging (fixed mindset) were more likely to give up in the face of setbacks, ignore useful feedback, feel threatened by the success of others and avoid challenges that could lead to failure. 

Dweck found that those who set themselves up with a growth mindset (seeing failure not as a sign of permanent lack of ability but a chance for learning and growth) were more likely to persist after a setback, embrace big challenges, learn from criticism and find inspiration in others. 
I often revisit this research as I find it so helpful in my own life to set myself up with a growth mindset when I tackle big things or face setbacks. Definitely check out Dweck’s work!

The complete answer may not be a simple one but decades before the internet arrived Zimbardo was conducting experiments like the one I described in this video and demonstrating the ease with which ordinary people can be led to engage in anti-social behaviour by putting them in situations where they felt anonymous or in which they could perceive others as objects or less than human. 

What are your thoughts? Have you ever behaved online in a way that you later regretted? What do you think contributes to this sort of behaviour? 

While the prison experiment was criticised for its methodology, there is much more literature on this subject. It seems the scenario has changed, but humans remain the same.

But when that need to fit in overrides the healthy boundaries that protect our own needs it becomes detrimental to our wellbeing. 

Developing healthier boundaries can often mean a shift from prioritising the approval of others, to focusing more on one’s own values. This is not easy to do in reality because it may mean facing disapproval from others. It’s helpful to remember that disapproval of others does not mean that your decision was wrong.

It is wonderful to be caring and kind to others. But, when you need to say no to something, or end a relationship, those things do not reflect on your worthiness of love, respect and belonging.

But when we conceptualise those physical feelings as excitement we are more likely to feel that we can tolerate them and move forward through the challenge. When we frame those physical sensations as anxiety we are more likely to do the opposite. This is why reframing can be such a helpful strategy for managing challenges that could be perceived in either way. If you can steer your attention toward the aspects of the challenge that you can feel excited about, you will experience the benefits of excitement over anxiety. Interestingly the sensations of anxiety don’t disappear. We shift our perspective of them so that we can use them to our advantage. 

My book covers lots of insights from therapy that help with anxiety. See link in bio to pre-order.

It’s not a problem to feel stress. But it can cause pretty big problems to stay stressed for long periods of time. It starts to impact on several aspects of your physical and mental health. 

But it’s all too easy to say “reduce the stress in your life” because most people don’t get that luxury. We don’t choose all the challenges that life throws at us. So if your stress is ongoing and there is no clear end in sight, start putting in some protected time to turn the dial down on the stress response, even for short periods.

But feeling numb and empty presents it’s own kind of hell. Struggling to feel anything at all can have a catastrophic impact on individuals and their relationships. 

I have spoken with women who feel so disconnected that they start to question their love for their baby or their partner. That might be the most pain I have ever seen in a person’s eyes. 

There is a way back. There is a way to start feeling again. But we can’t be selective about what we let in. If we numb one emotion, we numb them all. So, for anyone who feels disconnected, empty or numb, these too are signs to take seriously.

When your stress response is triggered, your brain is set up to look for danger. It tries to make sense of the information it has by making predictions for you so that you can do whatever is necessary to stay safe. 

When we are truly in a dangerous situation, this is an incredible survival response. But in today’s society, our stress responses are triggered repeatedly, in situations that are not life or death. So, when we start catastrophising, it is not followed up with action, and we are left with lots of worry thoughts churning over in our minds. 

When we spend time focusing on worst case scenarios, it re-triggers the stress response and our anxiety increases.

So how do we deal with catastrophising? First, we must begin to spot them. Maybe start by noting down at the end of the day, any catastophising thoughts that came up today. In time, you will be able to notice them in the moment, as they happen.

Secondly, when you notice that your thoughts are jumping to the worst case scenario, call it out. Label that thought as a catastrophising thought. A thought bias. 

Simply acknowledging the thought as a bias can sometimes be enough to help us recognise that there are alternative perspectives available, and thinking the worst does not mean the worst will happen.

The tricky part is that signs of anxiety can also be signs of something purely physical. For example, if you notice your heart pounding it could be a sign that you’ve had too much caffeine. If you feel shaky and trembly it could be dehydration. Always check in with the possibility that there could be a simple physical cause and keep up with the basics like sleep, hydration, healthy food and social connection. They may seem simple but there impact is not small.

Spending lots of time focusing on the future can make us anxious. But it’s not only thinking about the future that triggers anxiety. It’s trying to control that future. 

Learning to sit with uncertainty is a key skill in managing anxiety. Something that enables us to do that is building self-compassion. The two may not seem to go together. But when you learn to keep promises to yourself, always have your own back and act with your own best interests at heart, then it becomes easier.  You begin to trust that, no matter what happens, you will do the best by yourself and get through.

Here is a short version of how I sometimes explain it in therapy. What are your thoughts? 

It can be frightening to even consider psychological therapy for PTSD because it asks you to do the thing you most fear - think about it and talk about it. But no therapist would ask you to face overwhelming pain without first gearing you up with emotion coping skills to help you manage it safely. The right therapy at the right time can be life changing.

Anxiety tells us to escape and avoid. That makes sense if we are truly in danger. If we are not in a survival situation and the thing you fear means something to you and the life you want to live, then do it as much as possible. 

Whether it be learning to dance, joining that art class having never before picked up a paint brush, going to a party and challenging yourself to talk to someone new. If fear is holding you back from doing something that would enhance your life, take baby steps at first, and just start. Start today, and again tomorrow, and the next day. Keep going in achievable steps, however small, and don’t stop until it becomes part of your comfort zone ??

Social anxiety doesn’t stop the moment the interaction stops. We continue to focus on everything that we got wrong in that conversation, which further increases the anxiety and reinforces the fear response for the next interaction. 

To break that cycle, some people find it helpful to occupy your mind in the moments after an interaction to prevent the rumination from starting. Others find it helpful to practice mindfulness. But if you are new mindfulness it is best to start practicing in situations that feel easier to start with.

The power of any thought is in how much we buy into it as meaningful truth or fact. 

So if your thoughts are causing you distress, it makes sense to check out just how much we should believe in the thought. We can do this with a few different methods:

1. Thought challenging: this is where you put the thought to the test. List out the evidence for and against that thought being fact. Sometimes this can be enough to loosen off your belief in a thought that may have been biased. If this process leads to internal arguments with yourself about whether a thought is fact, then try the next method.

2. Practice being mindful of the thoughts. Observe them rather than getting caught up in it. Notice it’s effect on you. View it as an experience washing over you, rather than a part of you. Acknowledge that this is one version of reality, one idea, one theory. Then come back to the here and now. If doing this is difficult it can be helpful to write the thoughts down. This is called thought defusion, which means getting instuck from a thought so that it has less power of you and your actions. 

If you find these difficult to do alone you can get a therapist to support you.

If you answered mostly A’s this indicates a generally positive and rational acceptance of your body. This approach allows you to accept that your appearance affects how you feel sometimes. But, crucially, recognises that appearance is separate and distinct from your self-worth. It is not even close to being the most important thing about you. If you answered b’s and c’s spend some time looking over the A’s and write down some of the small changes you could make to work towards responding to your appearance in that way a little more. Your mental health will thank you for it.

The primacy effect impacts the way we make decisions. Our opinions can be more easily skewed than we think because we show a cognitive bias toward first impressions. The first time we get information about something is more easily recalled than what comes later. This is used by advertising agencies to manipulate decisions about product choice and by filmmakers who release trailers long before anyone has the chance to review the movie. 

But you can also use the primacy effect to your advantage. For example, if you have a job interview, always choose the first interview slot of the day if you want to be remembered and think carefully about what the information you want them to remember. Try to get that in first. Or last - that is the recency effect, but that’s a whole other video!

Maybe we never truly know for sure how we would react in a difficult situation, but would you like to help someone in need if you came across them? If you think you might hold back, what might cause that hesitation? 

Since studies began on the bystander effect many researchers have pointed out that we often see exceptions to that rule in which people step in to help, even putting their own safety at risk.

We know this because they are influenced by so many factors, including our emotions, physical state, and actions. 

The reason that many people find this life changing is that when a pattern of thinking is causing us distress, we don’t have to be at the mercy of it. 

We can choose to step back from those thoughts and see them for what they are; a mix of judgments, ideas, theories, opinions and stories. 

When we do this, it can take some of the power out of those thoughts because we have some choice about how much we buy into the idea as a fact, how much time we spend focussing on it, and whether we acknowledge other alternative perspectives. 

We cannot suppress thoughts and stop them from arriving, but we can consciously introduce new ones that, in turn, have an impact on how we feel.

I cover this in more detail in my book. See link in bio to pre-order

We block them out with anything that feels safe and pleasurable. But when we do that, the painful emotions don’t always disappear forever. We find ourselves trapped in cycles of addictive behaviours that keep the emotion at bay for just a short time. 

The way we guide people to process painful emotion in therapy is to allow the emotion to be there, turn towards it and feel it, while soothing yourself through the process with skills that help you to tolerate the distress. This enables the emotion to take its natural course and wash over you. Emotions come in waves so we know they will increase in intensity, peak and then come back down again.

We wait to feel this elusive thing called motivation. 

But here’s the thing about motivation. It doesn’t arrive out of nowhere. We can generate the feeling with getting clear on why we are doing something and then starting to take action towards it. Action generates energy and we can build some momentum. 

But that is not the whole story. Motivation doesn’t just arrive and then stick around. Like all other feelings, it fluctuates. The key to progressing in anything is being so clear on why you are doing it, that you can push through on those days when motivation is not there.

It’s not a fault of character or a clinical problem. But it can often be a sign of stress. When we avoid something it can be because we anticipate feeling something that we don’t want to feel. That might be stress, or fear, or even boredom. Procrastination can arise even more when perfectionism and a fear of failure is part of the equation. 

When we notice that we are procrastinating, reflecting on why that might be is the first crucial step to tackling it. Once we know what we are avoiding we can make a more informed choice about our actions instead of basing our actions on how we feel right now.

But I have seen the same problems occur beyond the scope of paid employment. For example, people who take on caring roles for loved ones are vulnerable to the emotional exhaustion seen in burnout. 

Burnout happens when the demands placed on you have far exceeded what you are able to fulfill for a long period. This leaves you feeling emotionally drained, physically exhausted and run down. It can start to affect your mental health, physical health and relationships and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. 

What are your top habits for preventing burnout?

It is often called square breathing or box breathing because you can find a window or picture frame to help you focus on slowing the breath and counting in 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, out 4 seconds and hold 4 seconds. 

Of course, if the timings don’t fit for you then you can adjust. The main aim is that you slow the breathing down. It can take several minutes so stick with it. Any time that your mind wonders, bring your attention back to counting the breath.

Research suggests that contempt is the strongest predictor of divorce. 
Contempt is more than criticism. It involves attacking someone from a position of moral superiority. Contempt is when we get truly mean. We call them names, disrespect them, ridicule and roll our eyes.

Despite the research, the presence of these behaviours in your relationship does not automatically mean it will end in divorce. Becoming aware of how damaging these behaviours can be, and noticing when they occur, is the first step towards change.

Look out for the mental filter whenever you are posting online - or any other time for that matter. This is a common thought bias that has the potential to make you feel much worse. So any time you notice that you are holding onto thoughts that focus on threat and loss, don’t let it go unchecked. Notice the bias, label it and take time to consciously consider the other information available to you. These simple tools can be really effective if we put in a bit of practice and use them regularly. Give it a try and let me know what you notice.

The self-help industry has a lot to answer for when it comes to promising people huge life transformations overnight. True change that you can sustain for a lifetime comes from changing small daily habits one at a time. You give that one small habit change your laser focus and keep getting back on track each time you return to old habits until, several months down the line, it comes as second nature without much conscious effort. Then you move onto the next one and repeat the process. Those small changes that you repeat over a sustained period of time, add up. 

If you want more on how to break bad habits and build healthier ones, let me know in the comments.

When someone is in a fixed mindset they perceive their abilities and potential to be fixed and unchangeable. In a growth mindset that person acknowledges the potential for improvement and change over time. A simple but powerful tool. Carol Dweck presents some insightful research on this. Setting yourself up with a growth mindset can improve performance and reduce the chance of giving up in response to hurdles and failure along the way. Small shifts in how you speak to yourself can be life changing because they start to influence our behaviour, performance, perseverance, and relationships.

Whatever your goals, getting into a growth mindset will help you reach them. In my experience clinically, I see how a growth mindset compliments self-compassion training to transform how people relate to themselves.

It’s not a personality trait that some are born with and others born without.

If you want to feel more confident at something you need to follow these two steps. 

1. Do it as often as you can

2. Be willing to do it badly and without feeling confident, for as long as it takes to get better

What area of your life do you want to build your confidence in?

What do you see? Is it spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise? Vertically or horizontally? 
The object will move whichever way you want it to. The object is not spinning at all but is just morphing from one shape to another. But your brain uses information from past memories to help make sense of new experiences, and we have very little experience of 2 dimensional shapes moving in this abstract way. So your incredible brain fills in the gaps and perceived the shape as closer to something that makes sense to you - a 3 dimensional shape. 

Your brain works in a similar way when it creates emotion. It uses memories to help make sense of new experiences.

We tell ourselves, “I should be over this by now”. Then a barrage of self-criticism unfolds every time the other person comes to mind. 

Grief does not work to a timetable. Like every other natural process, it takes it’s time. So allowing it to take its natural course is essential. But taking small steps toward the future and taking responsibility for our own happiness in small ways each day can help us to move forward in time.

I think one of the keys to overcoming self-doubt is to understand that those thoughts can be present and you don’t have to do what they say. You can step back from the thoughts, recognise them as one possible perspective and open your mind to considering others. Then making an informed choice about which perspective most serves you and giving the spotlight of your attention to that one. 

As with many of these things, it’s easy to say, harder to do. But with practice, things that once felt difficult become easy.

What helps you overcomes self-doubt?

Here’s a few tips for managing stress.  Often stress can be coming from all angles so it can be really helpful to sit down with pen and paper and write down what those things are. Then consider what changes you can make to your life that can help to either reduce the amount of stress by saying no to a few things or to build your resilience through adding in extra self-care such as strict bedtimes, exercise, daily social interaction and a more nutritious diet. 

Who else is feeling the stress of lockdown right now?

This might sound counterintuitive but try to take short breaks before you get tired, eat before you get hungry and drink water before you get dehydrated. By the time you notice those things, they are already having an impact on your energy levels and your willpower. So take regular breaks but keep them short and keep them active. Go outside and walk briskly to the end of the road. You may be back within 5 minutes but your brain will be more refreshed and ready to go.

Whether the drug of choice is alcohol, sugar, social media or TV, we just need to numb the overwhelm for a while. But we don’t want to come back from that numbing. It’s too good. The idea of turning back towards everything that overwhelmed us is not appealing one little bit. Therefore, the stress of it all still hangs over your head, going nowhere. 

Getting unstuck from the numbing is not easy. It demands that we base our next decision on what we want for our future, not what we want to feel (or not feel) in this moment. 

In these moments, taking too much time to think things through first can let all the overwhelm in before we have started and makes it feel impossible. Sometimes, in this situation, starting to move in the direction of what you want for the future is the way out. Acting opposite to the urge to numb and just beginning to put one foot in front of the other toward what you know needs to happen to get you back on track.

It can feel like an exhausting tug of war as the anxiously attached partner seeks out more connection with the avoidantly attached partner who never seems to be responsive enough. The avoidantly attached partner feels hounded and may see the other person as too demanding. 

Over time, that anxiously attached partner becomes increasingly frustrated and unhappy with the situation and there may be arguments. They may even threaten to leave. This ignites the fear of abandonment in the avoidantly attached and so, for a while, the discomfort of intimacy is overruled and the two may come back together. For a while everything is safe and they both freely express their love to each other. Until the old patterns of connecting start to creep back in. 

There are ways to change this pattern. Learning about attachment and how that relates to your own learning in life can build self-awareness. Then you can both commit to adjusting your behaviour. The avoidant partner may work hard to tolerate the fear of closeness and intimacy while the anxious partner can work hard to respect some of the boundaries of the other and seek to provide themselves with the feeling of safeness that they seek. 

Do you notice attachment styles in your relationships?

If you started to change that inner voice from bully to coach? 

Self-criticism and self-attack can become so pervasive that we stop noticing it all together. When it gets to sneak in under the radar change is almost impossible. 

To work on reducing that tendency to be self-critical, we need to call it out every single time. Whenever that critical voice pops up to have it’s say, don’t let it go unchecked. Notice it, label it and always come back at it with a kinder, more self-compassionate, alternative. If it is hard to think of that alternative in the moment, have a pre-prepared line that you can easily remember. Something non-specific that simply turns you attention to the approach you want to be taking. 

Does your inner voice sound like a bully or a coach?

When I started making videos and sharing tips and education from therapy I was anything but comfortable. I’m a psychologist who is used to working in a room with one person at a time. Being seen was scary. I feared what people I knew would think of me. I feared what other professionals would say. I feared getting things wrong. But I was confident that I could do it. I was confident that I was doing something that had the potential to make a small difference for people who might not otherwise have access to that information. 

So, you can feel fear and still be confident that you can get something done. To allow ourselves to fully experience confidence I think we must change our relationship with fear. Rather than see any spike of fear as a reason not to do something, we must recognise that some fear helps us to perform at our best and stay alert. 

When do you feel both confident and fearful? Do you ever notice how that fear helps you to perform at your best?

That is not an easy job. Your brain only has certain clues and information to work from. That means it makes mistakes. Sometimes it will struggle to find patterns and other times it will find meaning where there is none. The gambler’s fallacy is an example of this. We use the events of the past to help us make meaning. But when it comes to gambling, each event is not influenced by the previous one. 

This process is similar, whatever situation you are in. If your brain has limited ability to predict what is coming next, it will make use of your past experiences and memories to help. That is how past experiences have such an impact on our present. But, building our awareness of that process can help us to step away from automatic responses and make new choices.

Honesty, kindness, encouragement and support is what works best when we are helping someone to pull themselves out of a hole. But so many of us do not help ourselves in the same way. We are our own worst critics. 

Self-compassion is the rope that can help us out of the hole when there is nobody else around. We just have to grab it and start using it. 

My favourite way to step into self-compassion is to think about what I would do or say for my children if they were in my position. What would I want them to have the strength to do for themselves? Pick someone in your life that you love unconditionally and they are your shortcut to self-compassion.

I think all you really need is a couple of open questions that you can return to if you find yourself struggling to know what to say. 

Most important is not saying exactly the right thing, but the focus on being curious and trying your best to understand without judgment. 

It’s also natural to have the urge to fix it for them. You most likely can’t fix it. But the process of being with someone in their pain and showing them that they matter to you, showing them that you can tolerate their distress, this is what helps the most. Human connection and self-expression in a safe environment can get us through pretty dark places. 

What other ideas for showing support can you share with us?

• Be sensitive to changes in behaviour that may indicate struggle. For example, sleep problems, withdrawal.
• Be curious about their experience. Ask questions
• If they feel able to talk openly about how they feel, listen without judgment or comment. 
• Let them know that they matter to you and you want to support them in the best way. Ask them how they would like you to support them.
• If they want/need to seek professional help but find it difficult, offer to support them with it by making appointments or going along with them. 
• Remember you are not there to fix everything. A compassionate friend makes recovery much more likely, just by being there and showing support.

I have discovered that when I run towards discomfort instead of away from it, life gets pretty interesting. 

When do you feel that sense of imposter syndrome?

This might just be one of the most liberating things I have ever learned in my life so far. It’s a shame that it takes so long to learn it through experience. 

The fear of not being liked is innate in us all. It makes sense given that we evolved to live in groups. Any sign that we could be rejected from our community set off alarm bells in the brain for good reason. Our chances of survival were pretty slim if we were left to fend for ourselves. 

But we don’t live with the same dangers anymore. If someone decides to reject you, on Instagram or in real life, your world keeps turning and your life can even improve if that relationship was not a good one for you. 

When you do take that frightening leap into being unapologetically yourself, it is painful at first because people do disappear. But the ones that stay turn out to be the ones that are right for you. 

When did you realise it was ok to be completely you, whether others liked it or not?

When our mental health is under strain one of the most powerful tools we have is our connection to each other. Even during the pandemic when we are unable to physically be close to loved ones, we are fortunate enough to have access to technology that allows us to still look into each other’s eyes and hear each other’s voices. Human connection can help us to recover from stress.

Since I was old enough to read, losing myself in a good book was a favourite for me. I remember hiding a torch under my pillow so I could carry on reading after the lights went out. For others, that might be gaming, movies, crafts or music. What is that thing you do purely for joy? That thing you get so absorbed into that time can pass without you realising.

If that bully lives inside your own head, she is with you 24-7, chipping away at your confidence and mood.

When professional athletes hire a coach they choose someone who is inspiring, encouraging, uplifting, honest and loyal. Someone who has their best interests. Why wouldn’t any of us not want a coach for life? A persistent voice that helps us be our best as we navigate the challenges we face. 

If the voice inside your head sounds more like a bully than a best friend or coach, then it is time to do something about it. 

The way you speak to yourself is learned, which means it can be re-learned if it is not serving your health. 

Self-compassion is one of the tools that I have seen transform lives. If you would like more videos on how to use it, let me know in the comments.

This is linked to the spotlight effect in which we tend to overestimate how much others are focusing on us and scrutinising us. 

When we are not imagining disapproval in our own heads, sometimes it comes openly from friends or loved ones. That hurts and makes us question our choices and actions. Getting past disapproval from loved ones is much easier to do if we have absolute clarity on our values and the reasons behind our choices. If they are based on what matters most, the life we want to live and the kind of person we want to be, then our choices can be directed toward seeking our own approval. Doing this doesn’t stop the sting of disapproval. But it helps us move through it. 

How do you deal with disapproval from others? Do you also notice the spotlight effect where you overestimate how much others are scrutinising you?

If you need to say no this week in order to look after your own health and wellbeing, it does not make you mean or nasty. Trying to be everything for everyone all of the time can take it’s toll. Therefore, making careful choices about where your limits will be is a great tool for staying resilient. 

Saying no when you would usually say yes is not easy, even when you know it’s the right thing to do. Guilt will make an appearance, especially for those of us with people pleasing patterns. Tuck that guilt under your arm and take it with you. If you know that you are doing the right thing, you don’t have to let it dictate your choices. 

What will you be saying no to this week in order to prioritise your health and wellbeing?

It’s almost impossible to find a realistic portrayal of a lasting romantic relationship. 

In real relationships it’s ok to feel bored sometimes and not constantly head over heels. Finding others attractive does not necessarily mean you are in the wrong relationship. Your partners happiness is not entirely your responsibility. You are allowed to hold boundaries and say no. You can disagree, enjoy different hobbies, and spend time apart. 

Observing how people behave in other relationships and talking to friends can help us to work on our own relationship, but comparison is not helpful because we never really get to see what happens behind closed doors so the relationships of others may not be as rosy as we imagine from afar. 

Do you find yourself comparing your relationship to others?

Whether it be back to school, working from home or dreading the cabin fever of lockdown, you don’t have to be at the mercy of that feeling. 

When we want to turn that feeling around and feel more uplifted and energised, we have to turn towards the source of dread and not away from it. 

Ask yourself what has triggered the feeling and what it is telling you. Sit with it. Then make your choice. If you plan on having a better week than your mind is telling you will happen, start now. Make a list of what you do and how you do it, when you’re at your best. Right down to the small details of your day. We can often underestimate the potential influence these small changes can make on our emotional state. 

What are you dreading this week and what are you going to do about it?

It’s the very first day of clinical training. Everyone is sat up straight, tense, wide eyed and listening intensely. The course director stands up and starts talking. “You probably think that good luck has got you here and that you won’t be good enough to pass this course. You probably think that those sat around you are more competent, more experienced and more capable. This is imposter syndrome.” In that moment, lots of shoulders dropped, and everyone started looking around the room at each other smiling. Just having our fears called out made it easier to see them for what they were and let them go.

It’s hard to see imposter syndrome when you’re in it’s grasp. But just just being reminded of it can be enough to loosen off our belief in the stories we were telling ourselves. 

So count this as your reminder for today. Acknowledge your part in your success. You are allowed to like yourself for working hard toward something. When things go wrong, focus on behaviour change rather than making global attacks on your personality.

I also talked about this in my live with @fernemccann. 

The mask is the thoughts and emotions. When we fuse with the feelings they consume our every thought, action and how we perceive the world. Practicing meditation enables us to remove the mask and hold it at arms length. This takes away much of its power. It is still there but we can choose when to focus on it and when to consider alternatives. 

I have more detailed videos on mindfulness coming soon on my YouTube. Link in bio. 
This one is for @fernemccann

But for those all have a repeated pattern of normal mental health throughout most of the year and depressive symptoms during the winter each year, it can indicate something called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). 

It’s occurrence varies greatly depending on where you live in the world but with or without a clinical diagnosis, many people I come across report having mild symptoms. 

In part 2 I will offer a few tips on how to keep your mood up during the winter months.

Who else notices that it feels more difficult to keep your mood up in the winter?

So when you feel anxious and that, “What if I fail?” question pops up, always come back at it with the opposite. “What if it I excel? What if things go well?”

Remember, the relationship between your thoughts and emotions is two-way. You are more likely to think  about failure if you are nervous. But, how much attention you give to that question will in turn impact on whether your anxiety goes up or down. 

Treat your attention like a spotlight that you have control of. Turn it towards the best players on the stage; the thoughts that encourage, inspire and push you forward.

The full version is available on my YouTube channel (link in bio). I honestly could have chatted to her all night. What an inspiration she is to so many for talking openly and bravely about looking after her mental health and strengthening her resilience with therapy. 

One day, talking about going to therapy will be as simple as talking about a GP appointment or working with a PT. Courageous people like Ferne will have played a big part in getting us there. 

In this Live we also talked about mindfulness and how it can help with overwhelm. I have my own way of explaining it using the movie, The Mask with Jim Carey. In that movie, when he puts the mask on it grips him around the head and consumes him, affecting how he thinks, behaves and perceives the world. Overwhelming emotions can be just like that. It is hard to see any other way when we are in it. 

Mindfulness enables you to take a step back from thoughts and emotions to observe them with enough distance to consider other perspectives and get clarity on what is going on. A bit like the moment Jim Carey’s character holds the mask in his hands. He gets much more power over his own actions by getting just a little distance from it.

If you want to hear more, feel free to check out the full live on my YouTube. Link in bio. I also have lots more videos coming on mindfulness and other great tools with much more detail than I can fit into my reels, so go ahead and subscribe.

For me, the key is to manage what I focus on. I need to be active in working on the problems that I can tackle, to make the best of a situation that I cannot control. 

As all you parents out there will understand, working from home on a normal day is quite different to working from home with a house full of children. So I have started planning out how to do the best I can within the situation. I also plan to be kind to myself when I can’t do it all. And the one thing I definitely won’t be doing is comparing myself to anyone else who appears to be living their best lockdown life on social media. 

What helped you last time that you are pulling out the bag to get you through this lockdown? Let’s share ideas!

Do this at the same time every day and you build up practice at being able to turn your attention to the things that help. 

Everything that says you are not enough, not coping, need to do more, demands your attention because it triggers the threat response. While there is a need to focus on setbacks, focusing on them exclusively will cause problems. The practice of turning your attention helps you to use that skill more easily when you most need it. 

I would love to hear your reflections on how far you’ve come and the progress you’ve made. Share with me in the comments.

So, I would say don’t be afraid to think things through. Reflection with intent is not the same as dwelling. 

Do you take time for reflection on your goals? When, where and how do you make space for it?

It can be a signal that we may have unmet needs or it is time for change and growth. Sometimes, that reality is one we don’t want to face. But, if we don’t attend to the feelings and respond by meeting our needs, the pain can become much worse over time. In fact, those behaviours that help us avoid emotional pain in the moment, ( e.g. numbing out by keeping busy, eating, drinking alcohol, or anything else) causes us more pain in the long term. 

What is your way to numb out? What discomfort does it cover?

I first heard this about lobsters from Dr Abraham Twerski. You can find his description on YouTube.

One thing you must do if you want to sustain any changes you make in your life, is spend time working out the times when your willpower is likely to fail you. Then plan for each and every scenario. If you have a plan for how you will deal with each of those situations, you won’t have to depend on willpower alone.

If there is one thing that social media magnifies in our minds it is the perception that our appearance is both everything and never perfect enough. 

This time of year there is a marketing frenzy that targets any seeds of doubt in your mind that you may need to lose weight, tone up, or bulk up. But when we make decisions based on what we think we should do, what others are apparently doing, or self-doubt, we are much less likely to succeed in sustaining that change. 

If you do make any decisions to change your health behaviours or lifestyle, make sure it is based on what matters to you and comes from a place of unconditional love and compassion for your mind and body that stick by you and fight for your survival day after day. Happy New Year to you all. I sincerely hope that you all use this year to treat yourself with the respect that you give to your loved ones.

Whatever your experience of 2020, I want to thank you for being here. Thank you for supporting both me and the other individuals in this community. Each have their own story, their own strengths and their own pain. Thank you for being kind and encouraging to each other. We have come together and built a community of kindness, support and inspiration. We are breaking down barriers to make it ok for future generations to talk about their suffering and to educate themselves on the life skills that can help them to get through life’s challenges. 

After a restful Christmas I am more fired up than ever to bring you guys more value than ever. So bring it on 2021. We’ll be here, stronger than ever in our enhanced appreciation for the meaning of our relationships and community. 

Wishing you all health and peace and bags of love in 2021.

• Our ability to force ourselves to do things we hate is limited.
• When setting any goal make sure it is based on what matters to you, not what you see others doing or think you should do. 
• Be clear on why you are doing it. Write down why it is so important to you and keep coming back to it.
•When you hit hurdles or get off track (which you will) respond to that with compassion and honesty, not criticism and self-loathing. Failure is a normal part of change, not an indication of personality faults. Change is hard because you’re human. 
• If you can nurture your ability to control your attention and actions you increase chances of sustaining change. 
• Enough sleep is essential for your brain to exercise control rather than act on impulse. So switch your phone off and go to bed.
• Your brain also needs enough good quality food and water for optimal functioning and self-control improves after a healthy meal.
• Meditation improves self-control and enables you to improve the skill of choosing where to focus your attention.
• Focus on what you will do, rather than what you won’t do.
• Slow breathing calms the stress response which improves self-control and reduces impulsivity.
• Exercise also improves self-control and general health behaviours. It restores energy and willpower rather than depleting it as you might think.

What are your goals for 2021?

But feeling numb and empty presents it’s own kind of hell. Struggling to feel anything at all can have a catastrophic impact on individuals and their relationships. 

I have spoken with women who feel so disconnected that they start to question their love for their baby or their partner. That might be the most pain I have ever seen in a person’s eyes. 

There is a way back. There is a way to start feeling again. But we can’t be selective about what we let in. If we numb one emotion, we numb them all. So, for anyone who feels disconnected, empty or numb, these too are signs to take seriously.

But avoidance feeds anxiety. The longer you avoid something the more the anticipatory anxiety builds up and makes that thing seem even more frightening than it felt before. 

When you face the feared situation and stay there until the body calms over time then your brain logs a learning experience that you can be in that situation and survive. If you can repeat that experience several times, your brain starts to learn that the situation you once feared can also be safe. So the threat response does not trigger with such intensity as it used to. 

If you are tackling a phobia the key is to keep that exposure frequent and regular for as long as possible. Periods of avoidance in between exposure can make it harder to progress. From childhood I had a fear of heights. This is a particularly difficult fear to address unless you have the opportunity to be exposed to heights in day to day life. But every opportunity I get, I continue to put myself in those situations to keep pushing back against fear.

It takes everything you have to put one foot in front of the other and continue on. Deep voids open up where meaning and purpose used to be. Waves of intense pain and despair only give way to troughs of emptiness and numbness. 

People talk about grief as a wound, but it’s not the kind that heals over and disappears. Instead we build a life and grow around it. We speak the loved ones name, we share memories, we live in a way that honours their life as well as our own, we seek professional help when we need that space, we open our minds to joy once again. But only when we are ready. There is no timeline.

For all of those who lost a loved one this year, or any year before that, take your time. Treat yourself with the same compassion that you have for your loved ones.

Day after day, that inner dialogue seems to be either criticising you or other people, or society, or the world. You feel stressed and exhausted by it all, and why wouldn’t you? If that same conversation was happening outside of your head, it would be highly distressing and something you’d want to walk away from. But how do we do that when it is within our own mind? 

Now, there are no quick fixes if we are in a cycle with this, but here are a few points I think are important to consider:

* Mindfulness - stop and observe what is going on in your own mind, how you are speaking to yourself, judging others or predicting the future. Stepping back and observing our thoughts helps to give us the distance we need to consider a different way.
* Curiosity - This is my go-to alternative to a judgmental stance. Always looking at thought patterns and behaviours with curiosity enables me to learn from them rather than get stuck in any personal rules I may have about how things should be done.
* Compassion - always, always, always come back at self-attack with a compassionate alternative. 
* Values - aligning what we learn from those thoughts patterns with our own values can help us to get clarity on what really matters. This way we can choose which battles are meaningful and which are just vicious cycles that keep us stuck in dark places.

What helps you to break out those vicious cycles?

It’s when we feel something and assume that it must be true. When you make a mistake, you feel like a failure. So you assume that you must be a failure. 

You guys have all heard me say plenty of times that thoughts are not facts. Well, emotions are not facts either. They are a suggestion, an opinion, a sensation. Your brain is trying to make sense of the world. But it does not always get it right. 

Recognising emotional reasoning when it is happening, is a great way to start breaking the downward spiral of 1. Feel something. 2. Believe it must mean it’s true. 3. Behave as if it’s true. 

Once we build that awareness of emotional reasoning, we can call it out and make a conscious effort to speak to ourselves in a way that has a much more helpful impact on our emotions. I find honesty and compassion is a good mix. 

Can you spot emotional reasoning in yourself?.

Here’s a few tips on how to deal with negative thoughts. I think the key here is having negative thoughts does not mean you are failing at being happy or successful. It means you are human. We all have them. The part that we get to choose is how we respond to them. 

Some people find thought challenging helpful to loosen off their initial belief in a thought that may be biased. Others find that they get caught up in the internal argument of what is true and what is not. When that happens, I prefer to step back from that altogether and focus on getting some distance from the thoughts. Observing them without getting stuck on them or swept away by them. Mindfulness is a great way to flex that muscle of choosing which thoughts you step back from and which ones you spend time with. 

How do you manage negative thoughts?

Now, don’t get me wrong, I think being honest with yourself and working to improve is a great thing. But those goals are much more meaningful, purposeful and fulfilling if they are based on your own personal values. For example, if your thoughts of “I should be more kind to others” is based on your awareness that you have not always been as compassionate to others as you’d like to be, then great. If those shoulds are a barrage of self-loathing and relentless, unrealistic expectations that keep you in a trap of feeling like a constant failure, that’s the opposite of self-improvement. That is likely to grind you into the ground and leave you in a very dark place, feeling unable to do any of it.

So watch out for the shoulds and musts today. Don’t let them go unchecked. Ask yourself whether it is a meaningful value that can become a goal, or whether that inner voice is bullying you.

What are your shoulds and musts?

FOLLOW ME for more on self-care. When one small emotional knock brings you to your knees, it’s a sign. Don’t ignore it. It can be a sign that you are carrying too much, not looking after yourself, trying to hold painful emotions at bay. It could also be something simple. Maybe you haven’t slept well this week because you have children, or maybe you haven’t been exercising recently. Whether the reasons are complex or simple, listen to them. Ask yourself, “What do I need?” And then make it your mission to meet those needs. This is very easy to say, and not always easy to do. For example, I am a working mother of three and if I don’t get enough sleep for a while, that is not in my control. In situations like that I think we have to look for different ways to look after ourselves through difficult periods.

So I think it’s a great move, when you have a lot on your mind, to make the distinction between things that you can change and things you can’t. One example is the tendency we have to get caught up in other people’s mistakes or choices. It can come from a compassionate place and be rooted in love and concern for another. But if we find ourselves ruminating over these things, it can be less helpful than focusing on the things we can influence, such as our own choices and behaviours. 

So, in a situation that cannot be completely controlled or changed, what matters most to you? Who do you want to be within that imperfect world? How could you conduct yourself in a way that would make you proud and grateful that you made that choice?

Why would they? It is only in recent years that we have all started to talk more openly about mental health as just another aspect of our overall health and wellbeing. 

When I tell people what my job is, I often encounter many comments that  could be seen as naive to the realities of mental health struggles. But, rather than expect everyone to understand, I recognise that most people mean no harm and I do my best to educate from a place of compassion and awareness that, until you know, you don’t know. 

My acting skills here leave much to be desired, but in the name of making a complete fool of myself, I hope you had a giggle.

I think when everything feels overwhelming it’s a great exercise to re-evaluate those expectations. Being honest with yourself about why it is so important to meet each of them. Sometimes the simple process off scrutinising them under the spotlight can help us to prioritise the ones most important and let go of some others that may be based on something other than our own values. Some of the them can be rules for living we have set ourselves to feel enough and worthwhile. Others may be about the expectations of others, fear of rejection, comparing yourself to others, or perfectionism. 

At this time of year, so full of duty and expectation for adults, what is one thing you will let go so that you can focus on what really matters to you?

If we don’t know that a person struggles, it makes sense that we come up with different ideas in our mind about why they are behaving in a certain way. It’s understandable that we may easily take it personally, feel frustrated or annoyed. 

I have heard the stories of many people whose anxiety impacts on the way they interact with friends and family. They might cancel at last minute or procrastinate on replying to messages because the process of interacting triggers stress. They can often be torn between guilt and fear.

Keep a notebook by your bed. If you find yourself worrying about something, write it down. You only need to write a few words. Just enough to prompt your memory. Then you commit to spending some time thinking it through constructively the following day.
This can free you up from thinking that you need to solve it now or remember it tomorrow. It is also a key indication that bedtime is not problem-solving time or worry time. It is rest time. 

What other things help you to switch off at night and sleep?

The build up to Christmas can be a busy and stressful time for many of us so I am going to be making a lovely guided meditation for you all as a little Christmas pressie. Then, if it all gets too much you can lock yourself away in your bedroom and take a few minutes to chill out. 

A reel is not long enough to relax so I will put it on my YouTube. I will let you know when it goes live! If you subscribe to my YouTube you can also click the little bell and it will notify you when it goes on. 

My best wishes to everyone.

These were the results of a survey by Kevin Dutton to assess the prevalence of psychopathic traits among our workforce in the UK. 

Participants completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and entered the details of their employment. The lists in the video show which professions reported the least and most psychopathic traits. 

This is a fascinating area of research I have been reading about since watching @SkyTVs new psychological thriller The Undoing with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant. I couldn’t stop watching it and trying to work out who the killer was… Jonathon the surgeon, Grace the therapist, Fernando the husband. You can find out who did it by catching up on the whole series now, and head to @SkyTV’s YouTube afterwards where I delve into the psychology behind the series.

*PLEASE NOTE, the results of this study do not mean that people around you at work have a diagnosable disorder. It is simply traits that are found in many of us.

It is often called square breathing or box breathing because you can find a window or picture frame to help you focus on slowing the breath and counting in 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, out 4 seconds and hold 4 seconds. 

Of course, if the timings don’t fit for you then you can adjust. The main aim is that you slow the breathing down. It can take several minutes so stick with it. Any time that your mind wonders, bring your attention back to counting the breath. 

Let me know how you get on!

It is associated with depression, anxiety and relationship problems to name a few. Those experiencing burnout may notice chronic stress, sleep problems, anxiety and difficulties regulating mood.

Recovering from burnout is not as simple as taking a day off and then returning to the lifestyle that has caused it. The hard reality is that things have to change. The good news is that there are plenty of small and simple ways you can prioritise your health and still work hard to fulfill your responsibilities or goals. 

Start by getting a detailed picture of your week. Write down the times when difficult emotions come up, the times when everything is slightly less stressful and the triggers for stress. Also take a good look at all of your own behaviours that help and those that don’t. There may be plenty of small behaviours that you never realised were contributing to your stress. For example, maybe you stay up a little too long at night and that extra hour of sleep could make a difference the next day. Maybe, in your struggle to feel energised, you drink too much coffee during the day that causes you to feel anxious all evening and makes it hard to sleep. Maybe chatting to your partner about your day used to help you unwind but you no longer do that because you just want to block it all out. 

None of these small behaviours are the silver bullet that would fix everything but they all make their contribution. By taking one at a time and committing to a small, achievable change, you can gain momentum and start to see results. 

For some, a pattern of repeatedly working to burnout may be a sign of damaging core beliefs about not being enough and some rules for living about constantly striving to please others. For that in depth work, a therapist can be a great guide for helping you to formulate and work through it. The small behaviour changes may be a sticking plaster, but the therapy can clean out a wound that needs to heal. 

With the busy year I have had I am working on carving out time for rest and exercise. How about you? What helps?

But the good news is, there are ways to change these for healthier approaches. 

All relationships have conflict. But conflict itself is not always a problem. It’s how the couple argue and resolve their dispute that matters most for the longevity of the relationship. 

For more detail on how to work on this check out any books by Drs Julie and John Gottman. They make these ideas very accessible. 

I think it’s also crucial to point out that every relationship is unique. I’m sure most people have done at least one, if not all of these behaviours at some point. That does not mean your relationship is doomed to fail. Reading about them and building awareness of when they happen is a big step toward being able to choose something different. Even in the heat of an argument.

But whether the worst is happening or you are imagining the worst is happening, it triggers your threat response. Each time you go over it in your mind you get another little bit of adrenaline and your anxiety increases. As a result, you start to overestimate the chances of that worst case scenario actually happening too. You sit at home waiting for a loved one to return. It’s raining heavily and you start to imagine how dangerous the roads must be. You picture them in a crash and the police knocking on the door to inform you of their death. You play it over a few times and before you know it, you’re in tears and having a panic attack. An hour later, your loved one returns through the front door without any idea of what you’ve just been living through.

So watch out for those catastrophising thoughts. They haven’t happened yet and in most cases, it’s highly possible that they won’t. Just noticing when your mind is giving you catastrophe on repeat is a big step to being able to step back from them and consider and alternative perspective.

These beliefs are developed early in life through the experiences we have. Our brains pay close attention to any information that reconfirmed those beliefs, even when the beliefs are damaging. This is because it is more psychologically threatening to have our core beliefs about the world shaken because they give us a template through which we can understand our lives. For example, someone with a core belief that they are unloveable and can expect rejection from others may be highly sensitive to criticism from others or any signs of potential rejection. But beginning a relationship with someone who wants a close relationship can then feel confusing because they expect to experience rejection. Building awareness of our own core beliefs and the influence this has on us can help us to begin the process of positive change and free us from the vicious cycles we get stuck in.

What issue could be more urgent important than this: In 2019 the suicide rate for men in England and Wales was the highest it had been for two decades (according to data from the Office for National Statistics). 

Men aged 45-49 continue to be at the highest risk of suicide, but the numbers of suicides in young people have increased too.

Having worked with people in crisis who feel they have no option but to end their life, and having witnessed their recovery back to a meaningful life, I know that recovery is possible. 

Please use #internationalmensday to share this crucial message with the men in your life. It is ok to seek help when you are struggling. 

For anyone who is concerned about their mental health, visit a GP who can help direct you to the most appropriate service. Or you can call one of the helplines available in the UK such as the Samaritans on 116 123, which is free and can be used any time of day.

The reality of that is much harder, especially if those difficult relationships are with your family, spouse or other loved ones. You don’t want to end the relationship altogether, but you recognise that it is causing you emotional pain or even damaging your mental health.

In those situations, putting in some boundaries can help to improve the relationship and your own wellbeing. If setting boundaries in relationships is a new thing for you then therapists can be hugely helpful for this. The task is to carefully work out what boundaries will help you to sustain the relationship without it damaging your mental health. For some, that might be setting rules around how often you see them or how much time you spend together. For others it may be practicing the art of saying no. It can be a real struggle to be assertive or express our own needs in relationships in which we feel a sense of duty. So taking time to get clarity on the relationship in therapy can be life changing.

Follow me for more on self love  If you live in England then the word sorry is something you hear on a daily basis as you go about your life. It can be considered good manners in a variety of situations. But when apologising is driven by more than just cultural habits it can be linked to low self-esteem, shame and trauma.

So look out for those apologies today. Notice the impact they have on how you feel. Also notice what feelings come up if you try resisting an unnecessary apology. This can help us to understand what’s going on in more depth. 

Stopping all the unnecessary apologies won’t fix low self-esteem by itself. But it will help. Changing these small behaviours is a significant piece of the larger puzzle. 
I would love to hear all your comments on this

Just another example of your incredible brain at work. The reason you can make sense of the text is because your brain does a lot of the work for you, based on your past experience of reading. 

Once you are an established reader, your brain only needs the first and last letters to be in the right place. This is because you do not read words letter by letter, but as a whole, using your extensive memory of words to help speed things up. What an amazing brain you have!

Turning toward emotional experience with curiosity rather than judgment enables us to listen to whatever that emotion is telling us. Emotions often give us information about what we need.

Black and white thinking is a cognitive bias that we all do at times, but we tend to do more of it when we are stressed. Something small happens and, “the whole day is ruined!” 

This tendency to think in absolutes can make it harder to deal with hurdles because it triggers more intense emotional reactions. If we can only consider something a complete success or a complete failure then we are vulnerable to feeling like a complete failure much of the time. 

So look out for that all or nothing/ black or white thinking. When you notice it appear, call it out. Acknowledge it is a bias that is not helpful. The process of recognising the bias for what it is, will help to take some of the power out of it. Then you can consider alternative perspectives. Give it a go.

A lot of laughs were had in the making of this video with me trying to put on my ‘angry face.’ 

But in reality I understand how people find themselves saying these things with good intention. When someone is in distress, some people say nothing because they fear saying the wrong thing. For others, it triggers an urge to make it all better. So they say things like, “Well, at least...” or, “Just think more positively.” It is an attempt to relieve that distress as soon as possible. But these comments can invalidate the individual who is suffering and make them feel more incapable. 

So, what can we say instead? Well, it does not need to be profound wisdom and it does not have to make any of it go away. Just let that person know that you care, that you are here and willing to listen and support them in the way they feel is best. Then start listening. 

Now, good quality listening skills are not as common as you might think. So for videos on how to listen so that the other person feels truly heard and supported, let me know in the comments. And no comments about my poor ‘angry face’ acting skills ok? .

Cycles of people pleasing and structuring your life around seeking the approval of everyone else is a battle that never ends. There is always the risk of disapproval along the way. 

When it arrives it always jabs. That pain is only human. We are wired to care what others think about us. I think it becomes easier to recover from that pain of disapproval when we see our worth as separate from the opinions of others. 

It also makes a difference when we have a clear idea of our own values and what matters most to us. When you have a clear picture of the kind of person you want to be, the values you want to represent, then your choices are easier to make. They are less confused by worries about how to please everyone else. 

When you start to be unapologetically yourself, there will be people who disapprove or even leave. The ones who are left are often the most meaningful and fulfilling relationships.

Hit like & read caption-> Your abilities are not set in stone. When you try new things, practice new skills and repeat that effort, your amazing brain responds to those challenges by making new neural connections. The more connections your brain makes, the easier it becomes to perform that action without so much effort. It’s a bit like when you first learn to drive and you have to think of every move you make. Hours of conscious effort get you to the point where you can drive from a to b without thinking about it. 

So, if there is something you want to get better at, just keep practicing and challenging those skills. With repetition, your incredible brain will be able to do many of those actions for you while you think about something else. Incredible, right?

Share & repost - Someone might just need to hear this today!  Which train are you on?  Getting to where you want to go is going to mean sitting with some discomfort along the way. But when we get comfortable our energy and motivation to face that discomfort seems to disappear. So we wait. We wait until we feel like moving out of this comfort zone, which of course we never do. 

So if you have a goal that has been on your mind for years but you just don’t feel like starting yet, why not start today? Start by shifting the focus of your attention from how you want to feel now, to how you want to feel later. All along the way keep reminding yourself, that the discomfort is temporary, and it’s part of the process. Be willing to step into the discomfort and start moving toward your goals. 

Let me know in the comments, what is that thing you have been putting off, but would love to do one day?

You did something you regret and now feel terrible. What do you most need? Someone to shout in your face, telling you what a terrible person you are? Or someone to be honest but compassionate at the same time. Someone to say, “Ok, you made a mistake. You’re human. Let’s learn from it together and see what we can do next”. 

Most of us tend to go to the person who has our best interests at heart, because compassion and support is what we need. Receiving kindness changes our brain chemistry. It puts us in a state in which we can think clearly and learn from experience. 

The naming-calling and shaming puts us in threat mode, which leads to much worse outcomes. But that kind voice could be someone else, or it could be in your own head. To learn from your mistakes you must start with compassion and recognition that you are a fallible human just like the rest of us. Very easy to say. Very hard to do. That’s why I keep putting the reminders out there.

If someone displays just one or two of these, it does not necessarily mean that the relationship is doomed to be unhappy or abusive. But being aware of red flags can help us to recognise and reflect on those behaviours early on so that we can make an informed decision. 

When we are attracted to someone, we can have a tendency to overlook or accept behaviours from them that we would not otherwise put up with. As a result, many people get to the end of a relationship, look back and see the red flags in retrospect. 

When this happens, we get to learn from experience what we want and don’t want from future relationships. But many say they wish they had been aware of red flags before the relationship started, so share this with friends.? You never know who may need it.

There is no plaster cast to look out for. You may only notice a few small changes in someone you know. Those who remain fully functioning throughout depression can struggle for years without anyone having a clue. 

2020 has hit hard and pain is everywhere. It’s not written across t-shirts. It’s more subtle. It’s in the face of a friend in the street, whose smile no longer reaches her eyes. Blink and you’ll miss it, but she’s just a little more flat than before. 

I remember as a child I felt sensitive to how people around me were feeling and huge compassion for wanting to relieve that suffering. My work as a psychologist has helped me make use of that. I notice the smallest of leaks. The flicker of an eye, a shaky breath, a shift of the jaw. The emotion being held in tightly leaks out, drip by drip. This year I see it more than ever. And yet, there must be so much I miss too. We are all human. We cannot be responsible for everyone. But we can take that extra bit of care to look out for those around us.

The best tool we have to help each other with struggle, is connection. If we cannot be together physically, let’s pick up the phone. If we cannot talk on the phone, write a text. Talk, talk, talk. And listen. Don’t forget to listen.

“I’m just no good at maths”
“I’m not strong enough to cope”
“I’m not a confident person”

All of these statements reflect a fixed mindset. This is when we see our abilities and limitations as fixed from birth and generally unchangeable. 

A growth mindset is when we recognise that our abilities and skills can be developed with practice, learning, and persistent effort.

Here is the incredible part. A growth mindset is associated with better academic performance, persistence in the face of a challenge, and better mental health. Those in a fixed mindset tend to give up more quickly when things get difficult, experience more anxiety and depression and lower self-esteem. 

So how do we make use of this? How can we step into a growth mindset if we have spent our lives believing that talent is all that matters? One easy way, is to look out for the fixed statements, just like the ones in this video, and just add one word, “yet”. 

“I don’t have the skills....yet!”
“I’m not confident...yet!”

Keep coming back to the possibility of change, learning and growth. Don’t let those fixed mindset statements go unchecked. 

This is just one of many tools, so if you’d like more tips on how to get yourself or your children into a growth mindset, let me know in the comments.

Stepping into a new arena with new challenges will naturally trigger the threat response. When that threat response is switched on you are more likely to have thoughts about not being able to do it, not being good enough and overestimating the likelihood that you will fail. But having those thoughts does not mean they are true. If Einstein can feel like an imposter in his area of work then we all can. 

Something that helps me when I feel this way is to remind myself that I do not need to compete with anyone but myself. Experiences are not categorised into success or failure. The aim is that they all involve either joy, love, learning, meaning or purpose. When you feel out of your depth, you will be learning. So keep going!

So if the way you speak to yourself today sounds more like a bully than a best friend, it will be holding you back. 

Some people think that letting go of the constant criticism will cause them to lose their drive and ambition. That is not true. You can access a sense of drive from a state of threat (if I don’t succeed then I’m not enough) or from a state of safe contentment (I am enough AND I want to see how far I can go). When your drive is fuelled by threat it can lead to burnout, depression and anxiety. So your sense of drive is more sustainable if you also treat yourself with compassion and respect along the way.

This is the same reason that all world class athletes have a coach. Someone who can nurture, support, encourage and guide them. If those coaches used bullying to achieve their goals, the athlete may not last long in their career. 

Why not try it today? Don’t let any self-attack or self-criticism go unchecked. Give yourself the same respect that you give to everyone around you, and see how goes. Let me know in the comments! .

There is a way to fight back. 

A simple but hard truth about depression is that it gives you urges to do things that will keep you depressed. It says, “stay in bed today, don’t see your friends, don’t go for that walk, don’t tell anyone, hide away, numb this feeling.” Each if those ideas can quickly become addictive because they seem to work instantly. They offer immediate relief. You decline an invitation and breathe a sigh of relief that you don’t have to face the world today. As the hours pass, you are free to ruminate and your mood drops further. You feel even more disconnected and alone. 

So keep this in mind. Things that make it all go away right now, tend to bring it all back a little further down the line. Alcohol is a great example for this. You feel low and so you drink. For a while, you feel lighter. Everything feels easier. You wake up the next morning, and you feel worse. 

The key here is to know that, whatever depression tells you to do, it is not in the driving seat. You get to choose what you do. You get to choose whether you go with the urge or act opposite to it. In recovery, try to act based on what you want for your future, not how you feel now. 

If you are ever concerned about your mental health or someone else’s, please seek professional support. You can contact your GP, your mental health team, a local therapist or a charity support line.

Repeat that as long as you need to prevent anxiety from escalating and instead, start to calm the body. It may take a few minutes so give it some time. 

If the timings don’t quite fit for you then feel free to adjust. You don’t want to feel dizzy or light headed. The aim is to slow the breathing down. The counting also helps you to focus your attention of something in the present. When we focus on thoughts of things that may or may not happen in the future, that can cause the anxiety to rise.

Follow me for more help with anxiety. Feel free to share. Here’s how to use ice to help calm anxiety or other overwhelming emotions. 

Hold the ice in your hands, run it along your arms or face. Notice the sensations. The temperature, texture on your skin. If you are feeling overwhelmed with distress, splashing ice cold water on your face (also know as ice diving) can help to reduce your heart rate while at the same time providing a strong anchor for your grounding technique. This simply means, those strong physical sensations help to bring your attention to the here and now. So, if you tend to get overwhelmed, stock up on ice and give it a try.

Follow to learn more fascinating facts about how your mind works and how to use it to your advantage.

The spotlight effect is a phenomenon in which we tend to believe we are being noticed more than we really are.
Research has demonstrated that we drastically over-estimate our effect on other people and that we rarely have an accurate picture of how much others are noticing us and focusing on us. 

Those who experience social anxiety also have a tendency to focus inward, questioning how they are coming across to those around them. So you can see how the spotlight effect adds to that anxiety. They zone in on what they are getting wrong in a social situation AND then overestimate how much others are noticing it and scrutinising it. 

The first step toward using this to help with anxiety is awareness. Notice when it has happened to you today. You could reflect on it by writing in a journal. Over time it will get easier to notice it in the moment, as it happens. Once you can do that, you get to see it for what it is - a bias. Then you get to choose whether you listen to it or consider an alternative perspective and do something different.

When do you notice the spotlight effect happening to you?

We are all our own worst critics. But when a friend is having a tough time, we show them kindness because it is what they need. Imagine if we gave ourselves that same kindness, encouragement and support. How much easier it would feel to get back on our feet in hard times.

Real life has no filter. Real life has no tap to tidy function. In real life people do not wake up with their face and hair looking ready for Hollywood. In real life people do not have time to do 2 hours of yoga in full make-up before work. It’s nice to look at beautiful things, but don’t believe any of it. And don’t expect yourself to replicate any of it. 

Stay aware of how you feel during and after social media time and act on it with your best interests at heart. 

If you follow accounts that make you feel that you are not keeping up with everyone else, or accounts that make you feel ugly, or accounts that make you feel that you are failing, take control. Hit unfollow. Take a break from social media, turn off notifications. And see how your mental health improves. 

Now put your phone down and go do something that lifts you up .

Everybody struggles at times to know what to say. Sometimes the answer is to say nothing at all and to just be silent, allowing the other person to talk. But when you need to respond to someone else’s distress, here are a few do’s and don’ts.

When you begin to make changes that involve holding new boundaries, the people in your life may be shocked at the change. They may not understand the transformation you have been going through. Some of them may not like it, and they may let you know that they don’t like it.

Being able to hold those boundaries for yourself means allowing those people not to like it, and remembering why that boundary is important for you and your wellbeing.

This is always a difficult idea to teach as it can be the hardest part of many recovery journeys. When hard times hit we can confuse acceptance with agreement and approval. But we don’t have to like a reality in order to accept what it is. If we don’t accept reality, we spend a great amount of time and energy fighting against it by avoiding, blocking and suppressing.

Thoughts like, “You can’t do this. You’re too tired, you’re too out of breath. Why don’t you walk this bit?” If I believe those thoughts are fact, it has an impact on my original decision to run. I might slow down, walk, or give up all together. Since I was able to recognise those thoughts for what they are, ideas, judgments and expressions of discomfort, I can allow those thoughts to be there but choose something different. With practice you start to recognise the points at which your mind tells you to give up, and you can choose to keep going. Acknowledging your own thoughts as just one more opinion gives you the freedom to base your decisions on what matters most, rather than your current mood.

You know your strengths and you believe you have a good idea of where your limits lie. Then life throws you a challenge that is bigger than you ever thought you could face.

The pain is unbearable. All you can do is put one foot in front of the other, so that is what you do. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. 

Some time later you stop to look back and realise you have travelled way beyond that point where you once thought your limits were. 

Pushing against so much pain and resistance has hurt every step of the way, and it felt as though it was breaking you down. But here you are, a little bit stronger. You have pushed beyond your limits and now you have evidence that you can do the work to get through when you need to. 

So when life feels like it is pushing you to your limits, keep going. When you keep pushing forward, the struggle is not breaking you down, it is building you up. 

Unlike the butterfly in this story though, learning how to seek the right support can be the best move you make. Psychological therapies can teach you the skills you need to push through this challenge and others you may face in the future. So help in the form of therapy aids your learning, builds your strength and adds to your toolbox, skills that will help you time and time again.

Social anxiety does not always turn up in the way you’d expect. In fact, if someone is feeling highly anxious about a social event they may not turn up at all. 

When that happens it is easy for others to take it personally. But for some, social events can be terrifying. 

For those who do manage to face that fear and attend, they may be struggling against that anxiety the entire time. Their thoughts may be a mix of worrying about how they are being perceived and trying to think up ways to avoid the limelight or even thinking up reasons to leave early. 

So if a friend seems nervous and preoccupied, try taking some time to have a  1:1 conversation with them away from the larger group. Feeling supported as they face their fears can make all the difference.

But this is only true if we are worrying about something that can be controlled. 

If that thing worrying you can’t be solved with problem-solving, then it makes sense to practice refocusing on the present.

If your inner dialogue sounds more like a bully than a best friend then it will have a similar impact on your wellbeing as it would living with a bully 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

The way you speak to yourself is learned, which means it can be re-learned if it is not serving your health well. Self-compassion is one of the tools that I have seen transform lives. If you would like more videos on how to use it, let me know in the comments.

Please feel free to share and repost this 

How this illusion works:

A negative after image is caused when the photoreceptors in your eyes temporarily lose sensitivity. This is because they are adapting to overstimulation from being constantly exposed to the same stimulus for that period of time. Over time the signal to the brain decreases. Your brain compensates for that decreased signal by interpreting the image as normal.

Pro tips: Make sure you turn the brightness on your phone up. Focus on the X and keep focusing even when its changes. Hold the focus 

Question: Which object or colour takes the longest to fade for you?

If you did then this is know as the Stroop effect.

This short clip comes from the longer Stroop test that was originally designed by John Stroop in 1935. 
It was taught as one of the classic psychology experiments back in my undergraduate days and I’m sharing it with you as just one example of how amazing your brain is.

So what is happening? The Stroop effect demonstrates something called cognitive interference. You experience a delayed reaction because the information about the colour of the print and the word does not match up. 
How is this useful? This test can be combined with others to measure a person’s selective attention capacity and their processing speed ability. 
Here are two theories about why it happens:
The theory of automaticity suggests that recognising and labelling colours is not an automatic process so it takes time and conscious effort (maybe because you don’t often need to do this). The brain automatically understands the meaning of words because it is so well practiced at it.

Another theory is selective attention theory. This suggests that colour recognition requires more attention than reading a word, so it takes longer.

As a professional who has worked in mental health hospitals, crisis teams and intensive care, I have seen first hand that people can come back from the darkest of days. 

There are ways to heal and recover, even when your mind is telling you the opposite. I have seen people begin recovery, thinking that therapy is pointless and each day is a battle to survive. Over time, I have seen those people heal, recover and transform their lives into something meaningful, purposeful and much less painful. 

So if you have been struggling, please please please seek support. Human connection is one of the most powerful tools we have, so tell someone. Start today. I have included below a list of uk helplines. You can also speak to your doctor or contact a local mental health professional.

If you are in the uk, you can call Samaritans 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Call 116 123 free, even from a mobile. 

If you’re experiencing a mental health problem or supporting someone else, you can call SANEline on 0300 304 7000. 

If you are under 35 and struggling with suicidal feelings or concerned about a young person you can call Papyrus HOPELINEUK on 0800 068 4141.

If you are outside the uk, your services will be different. If you need help to find those, ask a trusted friend or family member to help you.

If you are ever concerned about your mental health, please visit your doctor or seek out a local mental health professional.

Not just any action, but action that goes against those urges to escape, hide away and avoid. When we escape and avoid, we get this immediate and addictive relief. In the long term, the anxiety grows and our confidence to face it shrinks. 

The action we take does not have to be big grand gestures. In fact, for them to be sustainable over time, they need to be small, achievable and challenging. 

So go ahead and do one thing today that gives you those butterflies in your tummy, and then relish that feeling of having burst through the boundaries of your comfort zone with intention and courage.

Don’t listen to them. 

If you are out there seeking a life of meaning and purpose, you will feel fear A LOT. That’s ok. It’s a good sign that you are pushing your limits, testing your strengths and learning. 

So instead of living fearlessly, why don’t we all just take fear along for the ride. Welcome it in. 

Taking on the world of social media has filled me with fear countless times. I know it’s because I am learning and growing. So I keep trying , every day, to base my decisions on my values, not my fear.

It is a natural part of being human, but only since the rise of social media have we been exposed to the carefully crafted, photoshopped versions of the lives of people across the world that we will never meet in person. 

We open up Instagram to take a quiet moment away from our own stresses, and find ourselves bombarded with perfect little squares that have little to no resemblance to real life. 

You look up from a picture of a model performing yoga on a beach to see a pile of washing up and a stack of paperwork. The result? You don’t need me to tell you, but I’m going to. This is BAD NEWS for trying to live a life that feels fulfilling and satisfying. 

So it’s probably not if, but WHEN you notice you compare yourself to someone else today, remember the following:

• Self-comparison is futile. That other person did not start on the same start line as you, and you are not even in the same race.
• If someone else is doing well at something that you are working on, then try to turn that into inspiration and learning. If you can learn from others, you can turn those feelings into gratitude for having the chance to come across them.
• If your thoughts of self-comparison sound like self-loathing, then pull your attention back to you. If it is someone online, click unfollow and turn back to you.
• Refocus on the things that inspire you, the values that you are trying to live by, and the goals you are working on. 
• Gratitude practice can help you turn your attention.
• Remind yourself that your worthiness as a human being is not measured by the successes or setbacks of anyone else. Keep treating yourself with love and respect, whether you are in a tough place, or a great one.

One of the most important tools for managing painful emotion is recognising the urges that emotions produce and understanding that we don’t have to act on those urges if it doesn’t fit with our values or maintain our health. 

It doesn’t mean that you can’t act on some of those urges. When you feel sad, you may have the urge to cry and spend the night in with a blanket and your favourite movie. That’s absolutely fine. When the sadness gives you the urge to do that day after day and your friendships or work start to suffer, and your mood gets worse. Then this skill becomes life changing. It means you get to choose when to listen to the emotion and go with it, and when to do the hard thing that is in your best interests. 

With this skill, we don’t have to be at the mercy of our emotions.

Gratitude practice is a great addition for your mental health toolbox. It is quick, easy, free and can be done anywhere, anytime. Those who practice gratitude every day show reduced stress and depression and more optimism.

Practicing gratitude does not mean that we invalidate our problems or pretend they don’t exist. It means we practice our ability to turn our attention. When we feel low in mood it can be incredibly difficult to focus on anything except the dark thoughts that arrive. Gratitude practice, not only gives us a little lift in the moment. It also helps us improve our ability to turn towards those things with intention, when we choose. A great skill for building resilience. 

Try a gratitude journal. Write down 3 things each day, or put a small note on your bathroom mirror and do it while you brush your teeth each morning. However you fit it in, it will be a good use of time.

Square breathing is a really simple way to focus your mind as you slow your breathing down. 

Focus your gaze on anything nearby, a window, door, picture frame. Just use it to trace your eyes around the shape as you count a 4 second intake of breath, hold it for 4 seconds and then breathe out for 4 seconds. 

Keep breathing in this way and tracing your eyeline around the shape  to help you focus. You can do this anywhere, any time and nobody even needs to know you’re doing it. 

It can take a few minutes to calm the body but it can stop anxiety from escalating. Why not give it a try

Things that make us feel better instantly, tend to have a negative impact on us in the long term. For example, if I feel anxious about doing a presentation at school or work, the urge is to avoid it. If I decide to skip that meeting or class, I get an instant feeling of relief from my fear. But, when the need to present comes around again, my anxiety is likely to be even more intense. 

A good alternative is trying to base our decisions on what is important to us instead. How we want to live, who we want to be. For example, if you want to be someone who builds confidence and lives life to the full, then skipping a presentation to avoid feeling anxious, might not fit with that set of values for you.

Follow for more to come.

When you feel anxious, your survival mode is switched on and so your brain is set up to scan the environment for danger. When you start to do this, you inevitably find more things to feel anxious about. The more you re-trigger the anxiety response, the more it can escalate into panic. 

So when you notice you are scanning for dangers, for things that may or may not happen, gently guide your attention back to the here and now. Something in the present. You may need to do that a thousand times. That is ok. Keep doing it. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to choose where you focus your attention.

It is based on the Standford Marshmallow experiment, a study on delayed gratification that was conducted by psychologist, professor Walter Mischel back in 1972. In the study children were offered a small immediate reward or the choice to wait for the chance to get two small rewards. They had to wait for 15 minutes while the researcher left the room. If they could hold out until the researcher returned, they were given two rewards. 

At the time the study found that those children who were able to delay gratification tended to go on to have better life outcomes such as sat scores, educational attainment and a few other measures. However, later studies with more diverse populations showed much smaller effects, suggesting that economic background may have played an important part.

Here are three great tools for communicating well and helping the other person to feel understood and listened to:
#1. Mirroring. Repeated back what you hear them saying, sometimes in their words, sometimes in your own. This shows that you are truly listening and taking onboard what they have said. 

2. Validation. Let that person know that it is ok to feel however they feel, whether you agree with it or not. Their experience is their experience. So even if it’s different to yours, it is valid and real. 

3. Empathy. Different from sympathy. Most people don’t want you to feel sorry for them. They want you to try and be with them in that struggle do your best to appreciate what it must be like for them.

Bottling up painful emotion and trying to pretend it’s not there is understandable when we have so many demands on us from all angles. However, when we squash those feelings down, they don’t go anywhere, they sit, waiting for you to get particularly exhausted and let your guard down. Then something seemingly small happens and you shock yourself by the intensity of emotion that you feel. 

If we allow ourselves time to feel whatever is present for us at the time, and soothe ourselves through it, we give that emotion a chance to be processed.

More tips to come.

I know this tip may seem counterintuitive because when we feel anxious all we want to do is make it stop. But most of the methods people use to block it out and push it away don’t work. This can add to that feeling of being out of control, which triggers more anxiety or even panic. 

If you allow anxiety permission to be there, you can soothe your way through it and wait for it to take its natural course. Soothing can be things that help you to feel comforted  while also keeping you in the present. For example, holding an object that has meaning for you, using a scent or perfume that you associate with safety, comfort or calm, or just focusing on holding someone’s hand. 

When you stop fighting anxiety and trust that it will rise and fall, it can take some of the power out of it for you.

When you make a commitment to work on recovery, it’s easy to get frustrated and self-critical when you have a bad day or a tough week. You may believe that you have gone back to square one. But this is not true. 

Throughout my whole career, I have never seen recovery, or any positive change, go in a straight line. Ups and downs are a normal and expected part of that process. The key to recovery is recognising those bad days are temporary and refocus on the skills that you need to get you back on track. You cannot undo the progress you have made and the things you have learned along the way. So keep going!

These are just a few of the many myths that surround mental health problems. These misconceptions are born out of a lack of education. For generations, mental health was a taboo subject that people did not talk about. During my lifetime so far, western society has made big strides in understanding human psychological needs and putting the subject of mental health on the table for discussion. But we still have a long way to go.

If you have noticed yourself putting things off, here are three things that correlate with procrastination. 

1. Perfectionism. Many people call themselves a perfectionist with pride. The truth is, some perfectionism can boost performance as we strive for great things. But there comes a point at which perfectionism becomes detrimental to our progress. It can stop us in our tracks and cause us to avoid a challenge that we might otherwise have enjoyed and learned from. Perfectionism at it’s most severe can have a higher impact on your life.

2. Fear of failure. Fear of failure is a learned response. None of us want to fail, but if we fear failure strongly enough, it prevents us from challenging ourselves and pushing our limits. Failure is a healthy part of growth, development and mastery. None of us ever learnt to walk without falling down a few hundred times at the beginning.

3. Stress. When we procrastinate over everyday jobs, it is often a sign that we just feel overwhelmed with the stress of everything. The stress of not doing something feels slightly less than the stress of facing it. This is when taking time to de-stress and recharge may be a good idea.

• Make sure you prioritise enough time to sleep as much as you need. Generating energy and shifting low mood is much harder if you haven’t had enough sleep.
• Move your body. When you do what your body was built to do it has a significant positive impact on energy levels, mood and how we manage stress that day. You don’t have to run a marathon, you can dance around your house to your favourite music or speed up your dog walk. Moving generates energy so this is a top way to shift that feeling.
• Call a friend and make some plans for the week that you can look forward to. 
• Spend some time reflecting on what might be triggering that feeling. Is it something that can be changed? Is it associated with anxiety? Or maybe your job is not right for you. Whatever it is, understanding the cause can help us to plan to make changes where possible.
• Try to stay in the moment. Dread can often arise when we are anticipating the pressures of the week ahead. But it’s not here yet, so refocus your attention on the here and now to give yourself a mental break from it. You can use mindfulness to help you practice the skill of choosing where you focus your attention.
• Add in some joy for the week’s agenda. If you dread the week because school or work is boring, then add in something each day that you can enjoy. 
• Remind yourself of why you are doing the thing you dread. Reconnecting with our values and why we are doing something, can help us cope with the fears or discomfort that surround it. School may feel boring right now, but you have dreams of becoming a doctor in future, or talking in front of the class fills you with fear now but you want to master public speaking, so it’s worth facing. 

If you have some tips of your own that help you to shift your mood and energy levels, share them in the comments

But when we do that, those emotions push back even harder. We find ourselves putting all our energy into blocking out that pain and it’s exhausting. The minute we let our guard down, those painful emotions come flooding in and knock us off our feet. 

Emotions come in waves. So if we can allow it to be present, it will take it’s natural course, increase in intensity, peak and then come back down again. There are some helpful distress tolerance skills that we can use to help get us through intense distress safely. For more on these, let me know in the comments.

One mistake many of us make when we have a goal we want to work on, is waiting until we feel like it. We wait to feel this elusive thing called motivation. 

But here’s the thing about motivation. It doesn’t arrive out of nowhere. We can generate the feeling with getting clear on why we are doing something and then starting to take action towards it. Action generates energy and we can build some momentum. 

But that is not the whole story. Motivation doesn’t just arrive and then stick around. Like all other feelings, it fluctuates. The key to progressing in anything is being so clear on why you are doing it, that you can push through on those days when motivation is not there. 

If you would like more on this subject, just let me know in the comments.

Treating others how you want to be treated is always advisable. But something that original advice misses out, is how we treat ourselves. The boundaries we set and keep for ourselves communicate to others what is acceptable and what is not. This can be incredibly hard to do if we have been taught to diminish our own needs in favour of everyone else’s.

Many people show great compassion to others but don’t include themselves. Many people do not see themselves as worthy of receiving such kindness. Or perhaps they accept disrespect from others as they do not feel deserving of anything more. 

Why not try it today? Treating yourself with the same love, care and respect that you give to others? Let me know how it goes!

Anxiety is there to help us make quick decisions in dangerous situations. When we are in danger, it’s a pretty effective survival mode that keeps us safe. When that survival mode is being triggered frequently, in situations that do not require it, we can find ourselves withdrawing from things that would otherwise be important to us. 

Life is much more satisfying when we are able to base our choices on our own personal values. This means all the things that matter to us, the kind of person you want to be, what you want your life to represent, the contribution you want to make to the world. 

Fear generally tells us to escape and avoid. But that is not always helpful if there is something you want to do with your life.

Developing healthier boundaries can often mean a shift from prioritising the approval of others, to focusing more on one’s own values. This is not easy to do in reality because it may mean facing disapproval from others. It’s helpful to remember that disapproval of others does not mean that your decision was wrong.

These statements may seem obvious to some, but many people are still brought up to believe that their worth is based on pleasing and meeting the needs of everybody else around them. It is wonderful to be caring and kind to others. But, when you need to say no to something, or end a relationship, those things do not reflect on your worthiness of love, respect and belonging.

The research conducted by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck looked into the profound impact that certain beliefs can have on our lives. 

More specifically, she noticed that those who believe their personality, intelligence and creative abilities to be fixed from birth and unchanging (fixed mindset) were more likely to give up in the face of setbacks, ignore useful feedback, feel threatened by the success of others and avoid challenges that could lead to failure. 

Dweck found that those who set themselves up with a growth mindset (seeing failure not as a sign of permanent lack of ability but a chance for learning and growth) were more likely to persist after a setback, embrace big challenges, learn from criticism and find inspiration in others. 
I often revisit this research as I find it so helpful in my own life to set myself up with a growth mindset when I tackle big things or face setbacks. Definitely check out Dweck’s work!

These are just a few of the common signs of anxiety. These alone are not sufficient for a clinical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. But, the aim of this post is to build awareness of some signs of anxiety and to encourage anyone who is concerned about their mental health to seek support from trusted loved ones and professional help from a local doctor or therapist.

Like and share with others  When you feel anxious or uncomfortable around other people, it is very hard to stay present and focussed on the conversation. Your thoughts drift off to worry about how you are coming across, second guessing your every move, and imagining the other person judging you. 

This adds to the anxiety because you can lose the thread of the conversation and the cycle continues. 

For those who don’t usually experience social anxiety, this experience can easily be triggered when you have lots on your mind or you are under lots of stress in other areas of your life. 

One way to manage this is based on the research that tells us people who feel confident tend to focus on others, while people who are socially anxious tend to focus inward.  Keep bringing your mind back to a mindset of curiosity. Be curious about what the other person has to say, what they feel, or something you want to share with them or learn from them. Curiosity takes us beyond a focus on the self to a focus on others.

Anxiety tells us to escape and avoid. That makes sense if we are truly in danger. If we are not in a survival situation and the thing you fear means something to you and the life you want to live, then do it as much as possible. 

Whether it be learning to dance, joining that art class having never before picked up a paint brush, going to a party and challenging yourself to talk to someone new. If fear is holding you back from doing something that would enhance your life, take baby steps at first, and just start. Start today, and again tomorrow, and the next day. Keep going in achievable steps, however small, and don’t stop until it becomes  part of your comfort zone.

Anyone with an anxious attachment style may struggle to feel secure in relationships. Our attachment styles are laid down early in life and can influence the way we function in our adult relationships. 

Attachment can’t explain everything that occurs in relationships but it can help us to make sense of some patterns of behaviour that we might feel stuck in. 

This is just a 15 second intro to a much bigger subject area, so if you’d like some longer videos on this, let me know in the comments.

The anxiety response is like a smoke alarm because it does not stop to work out the true cause of the warning signals it has picked up on. It just sounds the alarm. For example, you may get a rush of anxiety when you cross the road and suddenly spot a car car coming towards you at speed. This would be a useful time to get that rush of adrenaline that helps you get to the side of the road quicker than you ever thought you could move. The next day, you may get a rush of anxiety at just the thought of crossing the road again. This may be a helpful signal to take care crossing the road, but does not signal immediate and urgent danger. 

When anxiety gets triggered but we are not in danger, we have a number of options for calming the body and mind, to silence that alarm. These include, slow breathing techniques. When you slow your breathing, you limit the excess oxygen needed to fuel the anxiety response. If you would like some videos on slow breathing techniques let me know in the comments.

Other options include thought challenging, mindfulness, exercise self-soothing and relaxation techniques. For more on any of these let me know in the comments.

Just a little thought for the day, but a really important one to spend time reflecting on every now and then. 

When life gets busy, the to do list is never ending and life feels like nothing more than a daily grind, it is too easy to completely let go of the things that lift us up and make us feel energised and alive. But revisiting those things, even for a short time can do wonders in helping us to keep going. So whether it be a sport, time with friends, walking in nature, or dancing to your favourite music, whatever it is for you, put some time in the diary. Your mental health will thank you for it!

Could you see her go in the opposite direction? An online survey of over 1600 participants showed that around two thirds of people see the rotation as clockwise. Interestingly, those people had more difficulty perceiving the opposite direction. 

This is known as the silhouette illusion, created in 2003 by Japanese web designer Nobuyuki Kayahara. 

So why does this happen? The illusion appears this way because of the lack of visual cues for depth that help us to make sense of direction.

A psychology study suggests that a viewing-from-above bias influences our perceptions of it. The silhouette is presented with a slight camera elevation. So, you can see it from above or below. The person who has a counterclockwise perception is viewing it from below the silhouette. 

Pop psychology has wrongly used this as a personality test. They suggest it tells us which side of your brain is more dominant, but that is incorrect. However, a great little test to try out on your friends! 

Depending on your perception the change of direction can happen spontaneously. If you are struggling to see the opposite direction, try the following tips:

* Avert your eyes slightly and focus on an arm or a leg. Try to visualise it going in front or behind and then move your eyes back.
* Tilt your head to help you see a change in direction
* Close your eyes and visualise the dancer going in another direction. Then open your eyes.

Another fascinating aspect to this illusion can be seen if you place it alongside a mirror. It’s not what you expect. Check it out and see what happens!

Simple values exercises are a great way for all of us to check in with ourselves. Feeling unsatisfied with life can be caused by many things. Something I see a lot is when the demands of normal life cause us to drift away from the aspects of our lives that feel most important to us. 

A simple check-in to re-evaluate what matters most is a great exercise to do once in a while. If we notice we have been pulled off track from the life we want to live and the person we want to be, we can make small, conscious adjustments to re-direct our daily actions and habits.

These are just a few of the early warning signs for relationships that become unhealthy or even abusive. 

If you are at all concerned about your relationship or someone you love charities such as Women’s Aid in the uk and Refuge have very informative websites and can offer help and support. Alternatively, speak to a trusted friend, family member or your local doctor who may be able to help you access the support you need.

There is a misconception that depression is all about feeling sad and tearful. For some this is true, for others they cannot feel anything at all. They are numb to all emotion. They may feel like they need to cry, but tears don’t come, they don’t feel sadness, anger, joy or fear. The feel empty. When this happens, going about your daily life can feel exhausting, but time alone seems to open up a vacuum of painful nothingness. 

If you are concerned about your mental health or that of someone you know, seek help and support. Support may come in the form of a doctor, a therapist, a friend, charity or mental health team.

When learning about trauma and trying to understand how many behaviours can be understood by past traumas, I found it incredibly helpful to hear it explained in this way. Past trauma can be like having a serious burn all over your body. The slightest touch can cause extreme pain. If the person who brushed past you could not see those burns, they might judge your response as “overreacting” or “sensitive”.

We all get overworked and tired every now and then but burnout is more than tiredness. Burnout is when stress becomes chronic and overwhelming and has a detrimental effect on everything else in your life. 

Signs of burnout include chronic exhaustion alongside restlessness and trouble sleeping, poor self-care such as diet and exercise. Other signs include repeated emotional distress, such as anxiety, low mood, or anger outbursts. You may notice your performance at work is going down, while you feel you are working harder than ever, you may also start feeling disconnected with loved ones and struggle to get along as well as you normally do.

If burnout is on the horizon, here are a few things we can do to put on the breaks. 

•Start working out what you can say no to. Often we feel obliged to say yes to every request or opportunity. When our health is in question, it’s a pretty good reason to practice the art of saying no to things that are not an absolute priority.

•Prioritise self-care. Get back to basics because they are the foundations of good mental and physical health. Make sleep, healthy food, hydration, exercise and social time top of your to do list. And don’t underestimate the power of these things to build your resilience.

• Re-think what matters. We are vulnerable to burnout when we are working hard on something that is not in line with our own values. Taking time to think through how you want your life to be, the kind of person you want to be, or the impact you want to have on the world can help to get clarity on how to redirect your life in a way that suits you.

• Get support. If you are worried about your mental health in any way, seeking support from a trusted friend or a professional is one of the best things you can do and your chances of making a full recovery greatly improve. Human connection is a powerful tool. Use it.

People pleasing is not the same as just wanting to be kind to others. It is a pattern of behaviours that are detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the individual. 

It can be associated with anxiety about disapproval from others, fear of rejection or low self-worth. It can involve feeling unable to say no, even when the request is damaging to your own health, values or integrity. It can also lead to resentment in relationships, self-neglect and depression. 

Breaking the cycle of behaviours involves recognising the patters and the underlying cause, using assertiveness skills to say no when the situation could be damaging to your own wellbeing, and allowing yourself to receive the same kindness and compassion that you give to others.

So what is self-compassion?

Self-compassion means recognising when you are suffering and responding to that with forgiveness, kindness, encouragement and nurturing. 

Self-compassion means having your own back no matter what. It’s doing the best by yourself, even when it is the more difficult thing to do.

This is why self-compassion is distinctly different from self-indulgence. Indulgence could be doing whatever you feel like doing, taking the easy, safest or most pleasurable option. 

Self-compassion is quite often the more difficult option that is best for us in the long term. This might be making healthy food choices, saying no to relationships that are damaging to you. It might be getting yourself out of bed to make it to work, but then giving yourself a much needed rest after. 

It can also be making a conscious effort to talk to yourself with the same kindness and respect that you would give to a best friend or loved one in distress. The reason we are kind to those who are suffering is because we know it is what they need. So let’s do that for ourselves and watch our mental health improve.

Self-sabotage might show up in small ways, like repeatedly choosing foods that we know do not nourish us, or bigger ways such as staying in relationships that damage our wellbeing. 

Self-sabotage is a pattern of behaviour that can be changed. Building awareness of our own patterns and coming to an understanding about any function those patterns may have served in the past can help us begin the process of change. This can be examined through self-reflection or journaling, but these are often very difficult changes to make. So seeking the support of a trusted friend or professional can be key.

Mental health problems have no face. No one is immune. With a certain combination of events anyone of us could become vulnerable. 

We know from the research that human connection helps us to process stress in a healthier way. Social connection is essential for tackling mental health struggles so tag a friend in the comments and check in on them.

When someone is in a fixed mindset they perceive their abilities and potential to be fixed and unchangeable. In a growth mindset that person acknowledges the potential for improvement and change over time. A simple but powerful tool. Carol Dweck presents some insightful research on this. Setting yourself up with a growth mindset can improve performance and reduce the chance of giving up in response to hurdles and failure along the way. Small shifts in how you speak to yourself can be life changing because they start to influence our behaviour, performance, perseverance, and relationships.

Whatever your goals, getting into a growth mindset will help you reach them. In my experience clinically, I see how a growth mindset compliments self-compassion training to transform how people relate to themselves.

Many people hold the misconception that if they stop being hard on themselves they will lose their drive and ambition. This is not true. The best athletes in the world do not have coaches that call them names or verbally abuse them on the daily. They have coaches that encourage, support, guide and inspire. They have coaches who do the best for them on both good days and bad. This is because it is necessary to drive sustainable, high level performance and maintain wellbeing at the same time. 

Constant self-criticism and self-loathing is like living with a bully 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Not a good recipe for your mental health.
 
If you’d like me to do some videos on how to tackle self-criticism, let me know in the comments.

Like this and share with anyone who may need to hear it. I am on a mission to educate the world on the simple ways they can support their own mental health and resilience with tips from the therapy room.

Something people learn in therapy is that thoughts are not facts. We know this because they are influenced by so many factors, including our emotions, physical state, and actions. 

The reason that many people find this life changing is that when a pattern of thinking is causing us distress, we don’t have to be at the mercy of it. 

We can choose to step back from those thoughts and see them for what they are; a mix of judgments, ideas, theories, opinions and stories. 

When we do this, it can take some of the power out of those thoughts because we have some choice about how much we buy into the idea as a fact, how much time we spend focussing on it, and whether we acknowledge other alternative perspectives.

But your emotions also influence your thoughts. When you feel low in mood, your are more vulnerable to negative thoughts and all the thought biases that keep the low mood going. 

This may seem simple but it is hard to recognise that bias when we are deep in the emotion. Reminding ourselves that those thoughts are a bias, the dark lens of depression, this helps us to recognise that we can choose whether to go with those thoughts or allow them to pass and consider alternative perspectives. 

All this is easy for me to say, much harder to do in practice. But practice makes progress. If it feels hard to make progress alone, then a well-qualified therapist is a great option to guide you through.

Like and share to help me in my mission to educate the world with insights from therapy so that we can all enjoy good mental health.

Catastrophising is a thought bias that happens to everyone. When your stress response is triggered, your brain is set up to look for danger. When it can’t immediately detect danger, your brain is wired to imagine what could happen so that you can do whatever is necessary to stay safe. 

When we are truly in a dangerous situation, this is an incredible survival response. But in today’s society, our stress responses are triggered repeatedly, in situations that are not life or death. So, when we start catastrophising, it is not followed up with action, and we are left with lots of worry thoughts churning over in our minds. 

When we spend time focusing on worst case scenarios, it re-triggers the stress response and our anxiety increases.

So how do we deal with catastrophising? First, we must begin to spot them. Maybe start by noting down at the end of the day, any catastophising thoughts that came up today. In time, you will be able to notice them in the moment, as they happen.

Secondly, when you notice that your thoughts are jumping to the worst case scenario, call it out. Label that thought as a catastrophising thought. A thought bias. 

Simply acknowledging the thought as a bias can sometimes be enough to help us recognise that there are alternative perspectives available, and thinking the worst does not mean the worst will happen.

This is because your stress response signals, “all is not ok!” And so your mind starts to scan for any indication that confirms why the stress response has been activated. 
In this clip, the brain keeps coming up with new ideas for things that could lead to catastrophe, and the repeated checking is the safety behaviour that reduces the anxiety...but only for a few moments.

Learning that you are not at the mercy of your emotions is fundamental to overcoming anxiety. Once you are equipped with a toolbox of techniques to help, there is no need to fear the fear.

As people go through therapy, many people get frustrated and self-critical when they have a bad day or a bad week. They feel they have gone backwards. But this is not true. Throughout my whole career I have never seen recovery go in a straight line. There are ups and downs. The key is to recognise that the tough days are temporary and refocus on your goals and the skills you need to get back on track.

Many people struggle to let go of self-criticism as they believe it gives them drive. They have, somewhere along the line, been taught that self-compassion is the same as self-indulgence. It is not. If self-criticism and self-loathing was the key to living well, we’d all be on top of the world right now.
When we are struggling, what we need most is unconditional support, encouragement and kindness. These things make individuals flourish. Whether they are coming from another person or inside our own head, they are still the best way. So have a go. Imagine what you would say to a best friend in your position. That is usually along the lines of what you need to hear the most.

Depression gives us the urge to do the things that give us short-term relief but keep us stuck in the long term. For example, one duvet day when you are exhausted and feeling terrible, may be just what you needed. Day after day for a week may not be so helpful in lifting your mood and recharging you. It is likely to leave you lethargic, struggling to sleep, and struggling with your mood.

When our mood is low we tend to make decisions based on how we feel at the time. This is often because how we feel is so painful. Starting to base decisions on what is best for ourselves in the long term instead of our feelings, can be an essential tool in recovery from day to day low mood or more severe depression.

I could not find another psychologist on Tiktok doing the same thing. Some videos I couldn’t watch back. Couldn’t listen to the sound of my own voice. What would my family think? What would my friends think? What would my colleagues and other psychologists think? You get the theme. Every thought that held me back had something to do with other people’s opinion of me. 

Knowing about the remedies does not make us immune to the thoughts and feelings. They are a part of being human. Instead, it helps us to respond with resilience. 

So what helped me through it? Returning to my ‘why’. Each and every time I felt vulnerable I reminded myself why I was doing all this in the first place. That helped me to remember that my life’s purpose is not to avoid the judgment and criticism of other people. 

In reality, there will always be someone out there who dislikes, disagrees, or criticises us, no matter what we do. It’s unavoidable. To be resilient to it, we must act in line with our own values and do our best to have a positive impact on the world. 

So when you feel that familiar feeling of vulnerability, come back to your values. Be the person that you wish there were more of in the world 

Thank you again to everyone I am so grateful to you all.

Happy Tuesday everyone"

Thoughts can cause so much distress. The power of any thought is in how much we buy into it as meaningful truth or fact. 

So if your thoughts are causing you distress, it makes sense to check out just how much we should believe in the thought. We can do this with a few different methods:

1. Thought challenging: this is where you put the thought to the test. List out the evidence for and against that thought being fact. Sometimes this can be enough to loosen off your belief in a thought that may have been biased. If this process leads to internal arguments with yourself about whether a thought is fact, then try the next method.

2. Practice being mindful of the thoughts. Observe them rather than getting caught up in it. Notice it’s effect on you. View it as an experience washing over you, rather than a part of you. Acknowledge that this is one version of reality, one idea, one theory. Then come back to the here and now. If doing this is difficult it can be helpful to write the thoughts down. This is called thought defusion, which means getting instuck from a thought so that it has less power of you and your actions. 

If you find these difficult to do alone you can get a therapist to support you.

Follow me for more. It’s natural to value the opinions of loved ones. But if you never feel enough for them it’s time to focus on being the kind of person that you approve of. Live in line with your own values and any disapproval from others becomes much easier to deal with.

When the fight or flight response is triggered, you may not be aware of what has triggered it. That is when your brain searches for the danger that made you feel unsafe. It scans the environment and combines this with imagination to come up with a list of the worst things that could happen. In truly dangerous situations that helps us to survive. In other situations, it just makes anxiety worse.

That leads people to feel frustrated, as if they are not getting it right.
In a mindfulness practice we actually allow thoughts to arrive. But instead of grabbing hold of them, we just observe them as they pass by, gently guiding our attention back to the present moment.

It’s natural to want to feel liked by the people in your life. But when the need for everyone else’s approval takes over your decision making, it’s time for a re-think.
Something I have discovered in my work and studies is that seeking your own approval first can make it much easier to deal with disapproval from others. By this, I mean that you can make your life choices, big and small, based on your own core values. You work out what is most important for you and try your best to live in line with that. If anyone wants me to do a video on values exercises just let me know in the comments.

If you are interested in meditation I have a ten minute version on my youtube for you.

Many people feel frustrated by meditation when they think they need to block out other thoughts. Instead of trying to block anything, allow thoughts and feelings to arrive, and let them pass again, bringing your attention back to the present. Each time you do this, you build on your ability to choose which thoughts you spend time with and which ones you let pass. An incredibly powerful skill for optimal mental health.

Here is a short version of how I sometimes explain it in therapy. What are your thoughts? 
It can be frightening to even consider psychological therapy for PTSD because it asks you to do the thing you most fear - think about it and talk about it. But no therapist would ask you to face overwhelming pain without first gearing you up with emotion coping skills to help you manage it safely. The right therapy at the right time can be life changing.

When there is too much to do. When you don’t believe you can keep up with everyone’s expectations of you. Or when life throws you a curve ball and you feel floored. Those moments are all a normal part of being human.
The thought biases that hit us in these moments are also a normal part of being human. But they are biases, which means they may not always be a true reflection of reality. 
We can’t stop those thought biases from arriving but we can change our response to them. With practice, we can learn to notice biases when they occur and label them as such. Simply recognising and labelling a type of thought pattern helps to take some of the power out of it.

It happens more of the time when we are under stress. I explain why in this video.
To begin tackling overthinking we first need to learn the skill of stepping back from those thoughts and observing them as an experience, rather than getting swept away with them. Thinking about, and noticing patterns in your thoughts is called metacognition. Your thoughts about your thoughts. When we learn to step back from thoughts we are then in a more powerful position to be able to choose which thoughts we spend more time with and which ones we let go.

When working on anxiety in therapy we teach skills to manage the intensity of the emotion and then we start exposing ourselves to the object of fear. Using the skills to help tolerate the discomfort we stay with the feeling until our body habituates and calms over time. Do this repeatedly and the anxiety response will reduce over time.

Many people worry about how they are going to define themselves, what goals they will achieve and how that will look to others. Getting clarity on your values is much more helpful. There are lots of great values exercises that can help us do this. They involve re-evaluating what is most important to us in the various areas of life. Values are different from goals because they have no end point. They are paths we try to stay close to along the way. For more on this, let me know in the comments.

If you did then this is know as the Stroop effect.

This short clip comes from the longer Stroop test that was originally designed by John Stroop in 1935. 
It was taught as one of the classic psychology experiments back in my undergraduate days and I’m sharing it with you as just one example of how amazing your brain is.

So what is happening? The Stroop effect demonstrates something called cognitive interference. You experience a delayed reaction because the information about the colour of the print and the word does not match up. 
How is this useful? This test can be combined with others to measure a person’s selective attention capacity and their processing speed ability. 
Here are two theories about why it happens:
The theory of automaticity suggests that recognising and labelling colours is not an automatic process so it takes time and conscious effort (maybe because you don’t often need to do this). The brain automatically understands the meaning of words because it is so well practiced at it.

Another theory is selective attention theory. This suggests that colour recognition requires more attention than reading a word, so it takes longer.

We all get them. But, when you need to get going, how do overcome that feeling? One part of the equation is choosing carefully which thoughts you give your attention to.
We can’t stop the ‘can’t be bothered’ thoughts from popping into our heads. But we can choose whether to spend time ruminating on them or not.
To call a stop to the rumination, start moving, even in the face of that feeling. Just start moving. Take a shower, get dressed, start engaging in something that you enjoy and requires you to move your body. This alone can turn the mind away from those thoughts that could otherwise give us the urge to stay in bed..

I made this video long before the pandemic hit but I feel it is still relevant. In hard times, it is more important than ever to make careful choices about the thoughts we spend time with. We do not have to spend time with optimistic thoughts if we don’t believe in them. But spending too much time with negative thoughts is hugely damaging. Instead, when under strain, it makes sense to use neutral thinking. This means focusing on what is, and focusing on the next right move. Your mental health will thank you for it.

But research shows that the things that make us feel attracted to someone (physical attraction being the most significant early factor) is not the same thing that makes relationships last. Lasting relationships are more influenced by personality, shared values and friendship. Maybe this an insight into why such a big proportion of relationships end.

These beliefs are developed early in life through the experiences we have. Our brains pay close attention to any information that reconfirmed those beliefs, even when the beliefs are damaging. This is because it is more psychologically threatening to have our core beliefs about the world shaken because they give us a template through which we can understand our lives. For example, someone with a core belief that they are unloveable and can expect rejection from others may be highly sensitive to criticism from others or any signs of potential rejection. But beginning a relationship with someone who wants a close relationship can then feel confusing because they expect to experience rejection. Building awareness of our own core beliefs and the influence this has on us can help us to begin the process of positive change and free us from the vicious cycles we get stuck in.

If you got 13 you were correct. But did you notice the bear moonwalking really badly? 

This is a test of selective attention. The original experiment was conducted by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons. They demonstrated that our minds don’t really work the way we think they do. 
Attention is a limited resource and so our mind acts like a spotlight. It zooms in on a task and tunes out other details that don’t appear relevant. So our choices about what we focus on have a significant impact on how we perceive the world. If we spend so much of our time focusing on things that make us feel terrible, we can miss the other things that could change how we feel about life. .

It’s normal to feel anxious before you meet your therapist for the first time. Many people worry that they won’t have time to cover everything. Others believe they need to talk about everything in order. It is quite normal for that first appointment to feel like an outpouring of emotion and memories. It is the therapist’s job to work with you over time to unravel it so that together you can make sense of it all. The idea of therapy feels scary at first, but very quickly it becomes a safe place to express yourself and start making positive changes.

The mental filter. This is a common thought pattern (or style of thinking) when you feel low in mood or suffer with depression or anxiety (or any other mental health problem). We all think this way more of the time when we are stressed, upset, or generally overwhelmed.

Thought bias 2 – Jumping to conclusions

Jumping to conclusions. This is a biased style of thinking that we all do. But we do it more when we are stressed, depressed, anxious and overwhelmed.

Thought bias 3 – Personalising

Personalising is something we all do. But when it happens, it makes you feel worse.

Thought bias 4 – All or nothing thinking

All or nothing thinking, also termed black and white thinking. This is a biased style of thinking that we all do. But we do it more when we are stressed, depressed, anxious and overwhelmed.

Thought bias 5 – Catastrophising

Understand your thoughts. Catastrophising, a thought pattern that we all do. But we do it more when we are stressed, depressed, anxious and overwhelmed. I show you how to spot it keep it in check so that it doesn’t make you feel worse.

Thought bias 6 – Labelling

Labelling is a common thought pattern that is biased and, if left unchecked, makes you feel worse.

Labelling is something that we all do. But we do it more when we are stressed, depressed, anxious and overwhelmed.

Thought bias 7 – Toxic shoulds and musts

Watch out for toxic shoulds and musts and do things for you not just because others want you too."

If a person, profile or job makes us feel consistently unhappy, it makes sense to look at our part in that unhappiness. In some cases, it may be something to work on, in others, it may be about choosing to walk away. Stop following the social media profiles that trigger insecurities, leave that job that you have hated for years. Making decisions like these for ourselves are not always easy, but can be just what we needed. An example from my life is the simple choice to stop watching the news in the morning. Filling the mind with sensational bad news headlines every morning adds nothing positive to my day. Cutting it out has been an easy way to make a positive difference to my day.

Self-soothing is a skill used to manage overwhelming emotion. It’s the skill of committing to treating ourselves with kindness and compassion when we are in the midst of struggle. It is choosing behaviours that will help to soothe the body and mind as our distress washes over.

Importantly, self-soothing is not behaviours that block out the emotion. So drugs, alcohol, and suppression are not on the menu. Instead, we want to look after ourselves while the emotion passes naturally. To do this, we can use all the senses:

Sight
This may be photographs of loved ones or a favourite holiday. Alternatively it could be a movie or piece of artwork that makes you feel uplifted. Walking in nature and observing your surroundings can work too.

Sound

Music, singing, the sound of water. Sound is a powerful tool for changing how you feel. Make your own self-soothing playlist with all your best picks for feeling calm and soothed.

Touch

This can be comforting textures like a super soft blanket, a favourite pillow or cuddly toy. It could also be a warm cuddle with a loved one. Human touch is a personal one but very powerful if it works for you.

Taste

Slowly and mindfully savouring a favourite treat can help us to feel soothed (if eating is not part a safety behaviour for you). Strong mints can provide an anchor when we want to be mindful and stay present.

Smell

Sense of smell is actually the quickest way to calm the body. So if you like lavender or have a scent that you associate with comfort and safeness, keep some with you. Breathing in that scent is going to help you feel safe and calm very quickly.

Some of these you may use already, others might take some time to feel effective. So pick one or two and put in some practice. It is the intention of committing to take care of yourself that is key. Once you find the ones that work best for you, make sure you can access them when you might need it.

You can do this by setting up a self-soothing box. Take a shoe box and fill it with lots of things that you find soothing.

Everyone has good days and bad days. But we are not at the mercy of the mood we wake up with. Evidence shows that the following actions can lift your mood and get you back on track. No rocket science involved and you don't have to get up at 5am to practice yoga. These are the small things. They may seem simple, but these are the first things we let slide when we are feeling low.

?
To summarize:?
1. Sometimes we *do* ask for too much – we may ask them to fulfill all our needs.?
2. Sometimes we’re asking the wrong person to fulfill our needs. It may require reevaluating the relationship to find equilibrium. ?
3. Sometimes we get in our own way. We need to be self-aware of our own insecurities, and actively work to make sure they don’t negatively impact our ability to build healthy relationships. ?

?
1. The first step is awareness! Observe your inner critic – what is it saying and when does it show up? ?
2. Pause and apologize. Remember to show yourself the kindness you would show others. ?
3. Think about what emotions and truths might be hiding behind your inner critic. ?
4. Try to rephrase! It’s not about toxic positivity, but rather about reassuring yourself and changing your perspective. ?

For me, setting a boundary is a form of self-care – it’s how we keep ourselves and others accountable, and it can help us deepen our relationships. I love Sara’s interpretation of boundaries being a “blueprint,” or a map that guides a relationship. How do you create boundaries in your life day-to-day?

One question I grappled with when I was younger was, “why am I taking everything so personally?” The reaction is often an emotional one and sometimes those reactions are not grounded in reality. More often than not, it has nothing to do with us at all but rather it reflect the other person’s experience or reality.

To summarize:
 when you’re unsure of who you are, you’re less confident. and when you’re less confident, other people’s behaviour impacts you more.
 we’re more self-centered when we’re younger – we forget that people have their own lives and we focus only on ourselves.
 In our 30s onwards, we’re more likely to act as “gatekeepers” — choosing more deliberately what we allow in, and what we can acknowledge as someone projecting.

?
An entire NOVEL could probably be written on this topic – maybe it has been already  – but this is a quick summary of the most common reasons we may behave this way. ?
?
1. We may lack a sense of excitement in our lives, and therefore we enjoy chasing something inaccessible. ?
2. We may romanticize what we don’t know. Our desires can feel perpetually better than what we have in front of us. The whole “grass is greener” mentality. ?
3. We may have grown up not having our needs met, so it feels familiar to want the things we can’t have.?
4. It’s safer to want the things we can’t have because then we never have to grapple with getting them. ?
?
Do any of the above reasons resonate with you? For me, #2 and #4 hit home. ?

So…hands up if you’ve ever heard that critical voice before. 
Not everything you think is true. In fact, that critical voice likely didn’t start with you.
We are meaning making machines. It’s so easy to jump to the worst case scenario that supports your fears, insecurities, and wounds. That internal system really likes to look for evidence that supports your pain. So beware. Be careful of the meaning you attribute. And for now, notice. Notice your thoughts and see if you can take a beat.

# reelsrecoomender
This project is a demonstration of short video's recommender system which many of the social media platforms like 
YOUTUBE
TIKTOK
INSTAGRAM
use to keep their audience engaged.
This project has a flask server which acts as an api
This api is being consumed by a frontend which is available in my github repositories named as happymereels
